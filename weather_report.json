    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Boston, a delicate veil of patchy freezing fog swirls through the city, shrouding the streets in an ethereal, dreamlike atmosphere. The temperatures hover in the upper twenties, lending an almost crystalline quality to the air. A faint southwest breeze whispers through the alleys, carrying with it the promise of a gentle warmth that lingers just out of reach. The night is serene yet haunting, with the faint glow of city lights reflecting off the fog's soft embrace.\n\nTomorrow heralds a day of transformation, where the fog will gradually yield to a mostly cloudy sky. The chance of light rain flirts with the afternoon hours, but uncertainty hangs in the air like the mist itself. It will be a day to prepare for the unpredictable\u2014a light jacket layered with warmth will suffice for the morning chill, and perhaps a sensible umbrella for the chance of rain later in the day. As the world awakens, consider wandering into one of Boston's cozy cafes, where the scent of brewing coffee mingles with the crispness outside. The gentle murmur of conversation provides a pleasing soundtrack to this wintry scene, inviting you to linger just a little longer as the day unfolds quietly around you.",
