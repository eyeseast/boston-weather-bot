    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfurls in Boston, a thick shroud of clouds envelops the skyline, promising a drizzly embrace that all but guarantees the day will lean towards the damp and chilly side. The air is laden with the scent of impending rain, and a murky fog weaves its way through the streets, softening the often-harsh outlines of familiar buildings. Those venturing outdoors may find themselves accompanied by a curious chill, courtesy of a north wind that whispers through the avenues at a gentle two miles per hour. The high, resting around 38 degrees, suggests layers would serve one well: a cozy scarf wrapped snugly around the neck, a sturdy raincoat, and perhaps water-resistant boots to navigate puddles that will surely form. \n\nAs twilight approaches, expect the rhythm of the day to shift slightly, with the possibility of rain and snow flitting about pre-midnight. The evening will glide in at around 25 degrees, inviting a more resourceful attire to stave off the creeping cold. The overlap of rain and snow might inspire some to cozy up inside with a steaming mug of tea or gather for an informal gathering with friends over board games. For those obedient to the weather's whims, a brisk stroll in the neighborhood could stir a sense of camaraderie with fellow locals, all while braving the elements together. Today may not glimmer with sunshine or warmth, but it offers a certain charm steeped in the cozy spirit of winter in New England.",
