    "weather_report": "As dawn stirs over Boston, the night embraces the city with a soft blanket of clouds, hinting at the moisture that lingers in the air. The specter of rain, already whispering its presence, will likely be more insistent as the morning matures. A chill, still clinging to the low thirties, adds a crispness that brushes against your skin, a reminder of late winter's hesitant grip. As you prepare to step out, consider donning a warm layer beneath a sturdy rain jacket, while sturdy footwear will help navigate the soon drenched sidewalks.\n\nAs the hours unfold, clouds will thicken and the promise of showers will be fulfilled, with rain beginning to fall by mid-morning. Striding through the city, one might find comfort in a lively caf\u00e9, where the warmth of fresh coffee can pierce the chill outside. The south winds howling and gusting remind us of nature's unpredictable temperament, stirring leaves and creating a rustle that is almost musical. Although today might lack the sun's warm embrace, Boston is never dull; there are galleries to visit, bookshops to explore, and the tantalizing aromas of the city's renowned eateries just a short stroll away, inviting you in from the dampness for a cozy afternoon of indulgence.",
