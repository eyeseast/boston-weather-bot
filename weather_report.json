    "weather_report": "In Boston, a warm embrace of the sun graces the day as it awakens, promising a delightful journey through hues of blue and gold. The air carries the freshness of early morning, lacking any intrusion of fog, allowing for an unobstructed view towards the horizon. With temperatures expected to climb to a comfortable 83 degrees, the soft breeze from the southeast will weave gently through the streets, inviting both energetic walks and languid moments of leisure in parks or cafes. \n\nAs the sun treks across the sky, shedding its golden light, one might consider donning light fabrics and sun-friendly attire, perhaps a crisp cotton shirt paired with shorts or a breezy dress. As evening approaches, the temperature dips softly around 60, beckoning the use of a light sweater or a shawl for those peaceful twilight strolls. Given the pristine clarity of the day, it would be a fitting time to take in the sights on foot or bike, exploring the vibrant streets or savoring a book under an old oak. A simple picnic along the riverbank could be a restorative retreat, allowing you to drink in this enchanting weather before nightfall wraps the city in a calm embrace.",
