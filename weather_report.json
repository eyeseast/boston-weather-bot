    "weather_report": "In Boston, a soft veil of fog blankets the morning, casting a muted light over the day ahead. As you step outside, the air feels damp, mingling with the promise of rain that lingers like a well-worn song. Today, the sky remains overcast, with a persistent chance of drizzle escalating through the morning hours, lingering well into the afternoon. The temperature hangs around a cool 42 degrees, suggesting layers will be your ally; a warm sweater paired with a waterproof jacket should shield you from the chill and unexpected showers.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the potential for fog adds an ethereal quality to your surroundings, inviting one to embrace the quieter pleasures of indoor activities. Perhaps treat yourself to a comforting morning at a nearby caf\u00e9, sipping a warm beverage while admiring the soft glow of lights against the foggy backdrop. Alternatively, consider a leisurely stroll through a local museum, where the ambiance complements the weather\u2019s introspective nature. This is not a day for grandiosity, but for finding joy in the subtlety of moments that invite reflection and warmth.",
