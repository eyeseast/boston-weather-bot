    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, the air hangs heavy with the promise of rain, casting a muted gray over the cityscape. The chill whispers through the leaves, marking a shift from the warmth of the day. With a high reaching around 78 degrees, it feels somewhat stifled, the humidity lingering like an old friend. The weather carries with it a thirty percent chance of scattered thunderstorms, with low rumblings of thunder occasionally captivating attention\u2014a reminder of nature's unpredictability. As daylight slowly wanes, thoughts of patchy fog begin to arise, adding an air of mystery to the evening.\n\nAs night approaches, temperatures will retreat to a comfortable 68 degrees, making light layers an ideal choice for the remaining hours. A soft breeze flows gently from the southwest, creating a peaceful atmosphere for those who might venture outdoors. It would be wise to dress in breathable fabrics, perhaps a light sweater, as humidity casts its spell. As the gloom sets in, it may be a soothing time to seek solace in a favorite caf\u00e9, savoring a warm cup of tea, or perhaps to enjoy a leisurely stroll while listening to the distant hum of the city amidst twilight. While the likelihood of brief showers lingers, the promise of tranquility prevails, inviting contemplative moments under the soft blanket of evening.",
