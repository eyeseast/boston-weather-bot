    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the night, Boston groans beneath a soothing quilt of clouds, with rain gently tapping on rooftops, mingling with the whispering breeze. The air is cool, a precursor to the morn, as the world waits for the sun to break through the thick fog that lingers, turning the city into a muted watercolor of grays and blues. The remnants of autumn brush against the chill, inviting one to wrap a soft scarf around their neck and don a light jacket, prepared for the on-and-off embrace of rain.\n\nAs dawn unfolds, Boston will awaken cautiously, the fog playing its tricks, hiding and revealing the familiar skyline. Expect the occasional spritz from above as the day unfolds; let that be a call to grab an umbrella and stroll through parks, where fallen leaves carpet the ground. The air holds a certain crispness, tinged with the possibility of rain, suggesting this is a day best spent exploring cozy cafes or perusing local shops, finding warmth not only in this vibrant city but also in the company of a warm beverage. With the temperature gradually rising, layers will serve you well, providing comfort against the elements while allowing a glimpse of sun when it breaks through the clouds.",
