    "weather_report": "Boston's afternoon unfolds with an unsettling mix of warmth and humidity, beckoning from the edges of the afternoon sky. The air is filled with an undercurrent of anticipation, as the sun casts its gaze through an expanse of clouds, hinting at potential showers and thunderstorms that may sweep through. With the temperature reaching towards the lower nineties, the heat index intensifies the atmosphere to a sultry 101, urging those outdoors to seek shade beneath leafy canopies or to take refuge in air-conditioned spaces. \n\nAs night approaches, the promise of rainfall brings the possibility of thunderstorms, weaving a curtain of fog that will drape over the landscape, softening the city's edges. The low temperatures hovering around the sixties will invite a gentle comfort as the evening settles in. For the discerning inhabitant, light layers are wise to accommodate the steamy day while preparing for the coolness that will accompany nighttime. This is a day one might spend leisurely sipping coffee in a cozy caf\u00e9, watching the world drift by, or indulging in the allure of an early evening stroll to witness the dance of nature as it weaves between shadows and feeble bursts of light.",
