    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, a heavy curtain of rain envelops the city, accompanied by patches of fog that wrap around the creaking buildings like an ethereal blanket. The air is thick and damp, with a chill that seems to seep into the very bones. Visibility is limited, obscuring familiar landmarks, leaving only the silhouettes of structures behind a veil of moisture. The high holds a weary 42 degrees, offering little comfort against the relentless drizzle. As evening approaches, the rain will dance alongside light snow, painting the world in muted shades of gray as temperatures dip into the lower thirties. Gusts of wind whisper through the streets, a testament to the brisk northerly breeze.\n\nGiven the damp and chilly conditions, it would be prudent to dress warmly in layers, perhaps donning a waterproof jacket to combat the inevitable downpour and to ward off the cold that lingers in the air. A cozy scarf might offer solace as you navigate the murky atmosphere. Today is perhaps not the day for grand outdoor adventures; instead, one might find it more pleasant to retreat to the warmth of a local caf\u00e9, sipping a hot beverage while watching the world pass by through the foggy windows. Curling up with a good book or indulging in the latest film at home or in a nearby theater could provide the comfort and escape needed to soften the day\u2019s gloomy edges.",
