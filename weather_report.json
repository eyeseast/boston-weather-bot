    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls over Boston, the atmosphere is draped in a cloak of rain and fog, a muted symphony of cloudy greys and gentle whispers of moisture. The temperature lingers in the cool embrace of the early morning, inviting a reflective stillness as the world awakens under a sky heavy with promise of precipitation. Throughout the day, expect the rain to linger, teasing us with patchy fog that dances in and out of sight. Though the temperatures will inch towards the chillier side, a brisk northwest wind will waltz through the city, making each drop feel more poignant against your skin.\n\nFor those who must venture out, a comfortable but substantial jacket becomes an essential companion, while sturdy footwear is a wise choice for navigating the slippery sidewalks. Consider a scarf to ward off the chill from the wind, as it has an uncanny ability to creep through the smallest of openings. Today may not beckon outdoor adventures, but it offers a gentle invitation to linger in warm caf\u00e9s, perhaps with a book in hand as you sip something steaming. Embrace the opportunity to reconnect with the familiar rhythm of the city, its wet streets reflecting the muted colors of the day, as the rain plays its soft, soothing melody.",
