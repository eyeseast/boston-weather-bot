    "weather_report": "As night unfurls its dark cloak over Boston, the streets whisper with a gentle chill, discouraging the day's remnants while nudging warmth into the last embers of evening. The sky appears mostly cloudy, and a faint northwest breeze drifts through, escorting temperatures that linger around a crisp 11 degrees. No fog dampens the clarity of the night; instead, twinkling city lights reflect the determined spirit of a city embracing the quiet of winter\u2019s embrace.\n\nTomorrow dawns with a promise of continued cloudiness but invites a modest rise in warmth to approximately 28 degrees. The air will remain light, with a gentle northerly breeze, making it a suitable day for those who are ready to venture outside. The softness in the temperature could encourage a brisk stroll along the waterfront or perhaps an afternoon spent perusing the shelves of a cozy bookshop, savoring the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. To navigate this weather, dressing thoughtfully is advisable\u2014a layered approach will provide comfort: a snug sweater beneath a dependable winter coat, and perhaps a hat to complete the ensemble, making one ready to explore the subtle beauty that winter presents.",
