    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the atmosphere is cloaked in a muted gray, suggesting a day that leans more toward the dreary than the delightful. As the afternoon drifts on, temperatures hover at a brisk 39 degrees, with a south wind whispering through the city at around 12 mph, reminding all who venture outside of winter's inevitable grasp. The clouds are thick, dense and unyielding, heralding the arrival of wet weather as the sun surrenders to twilight's embrace.\n\nAs night beckons, the forecast offers a 100% chance of precipitation, likely starting with snow\u2014an ephemeral dance of flurries\u2014before the more persistent rain settles in, creating a mingled symphony of sound as it taps against windows. The air will chill as the mercury slides to about 33 degrees, and those heading out should take care to bundle up warmly. A heavy coat, waterproof footwear, and a sturdy umbrella will serve as faithful companions against the damp chill. Amidst this atmospheric embrace, consider the simple pleasures that can be found: a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the warmth of the drinks and the hum of quiet conversation can provide solace from the elements. Alternatively, a stroll through Boston\u2019s storied streets can unveil a unique charm, with the rain-soaked pavement reflecting the city\u2019s rich history. Whether you choose to explore or simply savor a moment of stillness indoors, allow yourself to enjoy this quintessentially New England day.",
