    "weather_report": "As the clock softly ticks into the early hours, Boston finds itself embraced by the faint embrace of rain, the air thick with moisture and an almost ethereal fog that clings to the city\u2019s corners. The sidewalks shimmer with the kiss of rain, each droplet lending a voice to the night. With temperatures settling in the cool realm of the low fifties, the atmosphere breathes a certain melancholic beauty, inviting both reflection and introspection.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, expect the world outside to remain cloaked in clouds, the patter of rain persisting gently throughout the day. As the sun struggles to make its presence known, you might find the warmth of a light jacket to be your closest ally against the chill, paired perhaps with sturdy waterproof shoes to navigate the damp streets. Amidst the intermittent showers, consider finding solace in the comforts of a cozy caf\u00e9, perhaps indulging in the simple pleasure of a warm beverage while watching the world drift by, or even embarking on a leisurely stroll through a nearby park, where the verdant hues of spring seem to glow against the grey backdrop. This day may not boast the brilliance of a sunlit escape, but within its clouds lies an opportunity for quiet moments and nurturing retreats.",
