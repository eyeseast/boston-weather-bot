There\u2019s a whisper of rain potentially teasing the horizon, but for now, it remains merely a chance, as shadows of the skyline are highlighted by flickering city lights. A steady west wind dances around 14 mph, occasionally gusting as if playfully challenging the late-night stillness. As dawn breaks today, the city will shake off its shrouded slumber, welcoming a partly sunny embrace, with the promise of a mild high near 56. The wind will continue its leisurely jaunt, nudging the trees and ruffling the leaves.\n\nWhile the day offers a hint of warmth, the cool breeze suggests dressing in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater beneath a windbreaker. It\u2019s a fine morning for a stroll along the waterfront or a quiet brunch at a tucked-away caf\u00e9, allowing the gentle sun and brisk air to energize your spirit. As the clouds slowly part and Boston awakens, one might savor a moment on a park bench, soaking in the transitory dance of early spring, preparing to embrace the vibrancy that the day promises.",
