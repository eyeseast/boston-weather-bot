    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, the city stirs under a sky adorned with wisps of clouds, casting a soft light on a day that promises clarity and the gentle hint of warmth. The air carries a crisp edge, quite typical for late November, with temperatures hovering around a mild 48 degrees. Today\u2019s sunlight will stream through intermittently, a welcome companion to the west wind that whispers at around eight miles per hour, making the day feel pleasantly brisk. \n\nTonight, however, a shift is anticipated; as you venture into the evening, prepare for clouds to weave a dense tapestry of gray, bearing the possibility of rain after three in the morning. It\u2019s a time when the quiet streets might shimmer under the damp sheen of a light drizzle, offering a cozy backdrop for those venturing out. When choosing your attire, consider layering\u2014perhaps a wool sweater beneath a light jacket\u2014to embrace the cool air while remaining prepared for the evening chill. \n\nThis is a splendid day for a leisurely stroll through one of Boston\u2019s serene parks, watching the leaves dance down, or perhaps finding solace in a quiet caf\u00e9, where the comforting aroma of coffee hangs in the air. Whatever your choice, let the mild clime and the soft light guide you through the rhythm of this autumn day.",
