    "weather_report": "In the heart of Boston today, the sky drapes itself in a muted shroud of clouds, punctuated with the occasional drizzle that brings the air to life with a cool embrace. As the morning unfolded, patches of fog meandered through the streets, blurring edges and softening the sounds of the bustling city. With the promise of scattered rain showers extending into the afternoon, it is wise for residents to carry umbrellas as they move about, navigating both the dampness in the air and the atmospheric feel of a moment caught between spring and summer.\n\nAs the day wears on, the temperature hovers comfortably around a balmy 76 degrees, inviting a lightness in attire yet demanding sensible layers \u2014 perhaps a stylish rain jacket over a simple shirt, paired comfortably with shoes that can handle a splash or two. The muted palette of the surroundings can\u2019t help but draw one toward indoor pursuits; a stroll through a museum or perhaps an afternoon spent at a cozy caf\u00e9 seems perfectly fitting, where the company of a well-worn book can keep one entertained as the rain rhythmically taps against the windowpane. As night approaches, the lingering fog hints at calm, quiet reflections, offering a serene backdrop to the evening ahead.",
