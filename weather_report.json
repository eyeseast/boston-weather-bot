    "weather_report": "This early morn in Boston wraps itself in a cloak of dampness, stitching together a tapestry of fog and drizzle that thickens the air with a quiet chill. The low temperature hovers around thirty-six degrees, a reminder that winter\u2019s hold remains steadfast. As the night fades and the dawn unfurls, the southern winds whisper softly, hinting at a day that, while mostly cloudy, will bear the potential for sporadic rain. The hint of moisture lingers in the atmosphere, promising little more than a trace of new precipitation\u2014enough to tease the earth but not enough to saturate it fully.\n\nAs you step outside, a practical choice in attire is perhaps best: layer wisely, with a warm coat to ward off the bite of the cold and a scarf to shield against the damp breath of fog. A sturdy umbrella could serve as a faithful companion, though it may only lightly catch the gentle drizzle. It\u2019s a day fit for the modest pleasures of life\u2014perhaps a quiet stroll along the Esplanade, where the river\u2019s reflection dances mischievously in the subdued light, or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 where the warmth of a fresh brew invites moments of pause. Such an environment, though cloaked in gray, offers a comforting embrace for those willing to forge ahead.",
