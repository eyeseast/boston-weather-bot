    "weather_report": "As midnight settles over Boston, a gentle hush envelops the city, softening the outlines of its storied skyline. The night is cloaked in a veil of clouds, promising the faint possibility of rain before dawn. A chill lingers in the air, suggesting that the low temperature could invite a light jacket for those who venture out into the quiet. The eastward breeze, a whisper of autumn\u2019s approach, brushes lightly against your skin, hinting at the complexities of a late spring that hesitates to fully embrace warmth. \n\nAs Monday unfolds, the atmospheric dance continues, with a slight chance of rain showers lingering like an uninvited guest. The gray clouds may obscure the sun\u2019s brilliance, but the earth below remains a vibrant tableau waiting to be explored. With a high approaching 65\u00b0F, the day could call for layered garments\u2014perhaps a comfortable sweater accompanied by sturdy shoes for perambulation through the city's storied streets or a stroll along the banks of the Charles. Consider visiting a cozy caf\u00e9 to sip a robust brew while the city awakens around you. Whether you choose to immerse yourself in an art exhibit or wander through a tranquil park, the day invites a blend of introspection and gentle exploration, all against a backdrop of subdued beauty.",
