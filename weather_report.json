    "weather_report": "In Boston, the afternoon unfolds under a blanket of relentless gray, with rain showers easing in a dance with pockets of fog set to envelop the city. The air, thick with moisture, is a reminder of the season\u2019s chill, as temperatures hover around a modest fifty-six degrees. A gentle north wind whispers through the streets, but the clouds hang low and heavy, casting an almost melancholic hue over familiar landmarks. As dusk approaches, this fog is likely to deepen, lingering like a soft shroud, whilst areas of wet pavement glimmer reflectively under the fading light. \n\nAs you step outside, perhaps to enjoy a quiet walk or to grab a warm beverage from a favorite caf\u00e9, dressing in layers is essential for navigating the shifting temperatures. A light waterproof jacket can offer comfort from the light rain, complemented by a cozy sweater as the evening promises a chill, dipping to around thirty-two degrees. Tonight, the chance of rain showers persists before 9 PM, a fitting accompaniment to the murky atmosphere, suggesting indoor pursuits might be best. Embrace the art of savoring a good book or indulging in a creative hobby, nourished by the gentle rhythms of rain and fog entwining outside.",
