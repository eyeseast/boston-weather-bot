    "weather_report": "In the hushed hours of the night, rain taps gently against window panes, enveloping Boston in a soft, persistent embrace. The air is thick with the chill of early spring, a gentle reminder that warmth lies just out of reach. As the city stirs awake, a veil of fog hangs low, casting an ethereal glow over the skyline. The northeast wind whispers through the trees, carrying with it the scent of rain-soaked earth and the promise of a day marked by cloud and drizzle\u2014a palette of muted grays.\n\nAs daylight breaks, Boston will awaken to a landscape that feels subdued yet strangely inviting. Expect pockets of fog and a lingering chance of sleet before the morning fully unfolds. The temperature will hold steady, keeping the atmosphere crisp and cool. While the day may feel gloomy, it presents an opportunity for quiet reflection or moments of creativity indoors. One might dress in layered comfort, wrapping themselves in a warm scarf and a water-resistant jacket to guard against the unpredictable rain. Rather than seeking out the bustle of outdoor activities, consider settling into a cozy caf\u00e9, indulging in warm brews as the world outside drizzles and drifts. It's a time for savoring stillness, perhaps with a well-worn book in hand, as both the rain and fog create an invitation to pause, breathe, and enjoy the quiet nuances of the day.",
