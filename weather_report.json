    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Boston, a veil of cloudiness enfolds the city in muted tones. The temperature dips to a brisk chill of twenty-one degrees, inviting homes to offer refuge and warmth. The faint north wind whispers through the streets, a soft reminder of the winter\u2019s lingering grasp. As one gazes out, the horizon is obscured, the distant lights flickering through a gentle haze, perhaps hinting at the shift to a more wintry embrace as tomorrow unfolds.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, a slight chance of snow emerges in the late afternoon, adding an element of intrigue to the air. The day will be cast in a cloak of clouds, with a high near thirty-six, the northeast wind adding a crisp edge to the chill. While outdoor ventures may beckon, it is prudent to layer sensibly for warmth, perhaps a wool scarf wrapped snugly and a warm beanie perched atop one\u2019s head. As the day wears on and the potential for flurries draws near, a leisurely stroll through a quiet neighborhood or the solace of a caf\u00e9 with a steaming cup in hand, watching the world transform around you, may serve as perfect companions to this enigmatic winter day.",
