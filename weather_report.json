    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Boston, the air is thickened by a persistent rain, casting a dim and moody ambiance over the city. The clouds hang low, cloaking the skyline in a shroud of gray that hints at the tantalizing warmth of autumn just out of reach. A brisk northeast wind whistles through the streets, rustling the leaves that still cling to life, while the steady rhythm of rain drums softly against windows and sidewalks, drawing people inward to cozy nooks and warm drinks. A chill lingers, whispering the kind of cold that seeps through layers, making one long for something heavier \u2013 perhaps a well-loved sweater or a waterproof jacket.\n\nLooking ahead, Columbus Day will greet early risers with the same drizzly embrace, with expectations of rain continuing throughout the day. The high will barely rise above the cool embrace of 57 degrees, inviting thoughts of indoor pursuits over outdoor wanderings. One might consider a leisurely visit to a small caf\u00e9, where the scent of fresh pastry mingles harmoniously with steaming coffee, or perhaps settle into a lively bookstore, letting oneself get lost among pages printed with the stories of others. The day may not yield sunshine, but it offers an opportunity for reflection and the comfort of the familiar, making it a perfect time to savor the simple pleasures of life.",
