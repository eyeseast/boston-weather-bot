    "weather_report": "The afternoon sun graces Boston with clear skies, illuminating the city in soft, golden light, a delightful contrast to the lingering chill of early spring. With temperatures bordering on 47 degrees, it beckons residents to step outside and savor the crisp air, enhanced by a gentle westward breeze. As twilight approaches, the temperature will dip to a comfortable 28 degrees, promising a serene evening under a canopy of stars.\n\nToday\u2019s clarity calls for a refreshing jaunt to your favorite caf\u00e9 or a leisurely stroll along the Esplanade, where the scent of blooming daffodils mingles with the fresh air. Dress in layers to accommodate the fluctuating temperatures; a light sweater over a long-sleeved shirt will keep you comfortable during the day\u2019s warmth while a thicker coat or scarf will serve you well as nightfall descends. The pleasant conditions are perfect for enjoying a quiet moment with a good book in your favorite park or catching up with a friend over a warm drink, as Boston revels in a beautiful spring day.",
