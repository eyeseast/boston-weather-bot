    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Boston, a gentle chill lingers in the air, whispering of the night to come. The skies, mostly clear, are punctuated by the faint glimmer of starlight, a serene backdrop for the city\u2019s own twinkling lights. Tonight\u2019s forecast calls for partly cloudy skies with temperatures dipping to a refreshing low of around 15 degrees, while a steady northwest wind briskly carries the crispness through the streets. The gusts may fly higher than a passing train, stirring leaves and sending a shiver up one\u2019s spine. It\u2019s a night that beckons for warmth, perhaps a thick scarf and a sturdy coat, as one ventures into the quiet beauty of Boston.\n\nTomorrow promises a more cheerful demeanor as the sun rises to unveil a mostly sunny day with temperatures climbing towards 27 degrees. The gentle winds, while still present, will lend a lively touch rather than a biting cold, making it an enjoyable day for a stroll through the parks or a quiet coffee on a sun-drenched terrace. Grabbing a light jacket might be wise, as the early morning chill could linger. The clarity of the day alongside the invigorating atmosphere invites both contemplation and leisurely exploration, perfect for taking part in the city\u2019s quiet corners or enjoyed alongside a good book in the company of the sun.",
