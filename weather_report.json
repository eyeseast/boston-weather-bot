    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Boston, a veil of clouds wraps the city in a soft, muted embrace. The air is crisp, carrying temperatures that drop to a cool 21 degrees, while a gentle breeze whispers through the streets at just a hint of two miles per hour. The night is stark but serene, a calm before the partial dawn set to rise on Washington's Birthday. Tomorrow promises a flirtation with sunshine, though the chill will persist with highs near 37 degrees, an invitation for coats and layered attire.\n\nTonight\u2019s muted palette of grays and blacks suggests a moment for quiet contemplation, perhaps best spent with a warm drink cradled in your hands while watching the world unfurl from the comfort of your home. For the more adventurous souls, an evening stroll could reveal the serene beauty of Boston's twinkling lights reflected against the dark canvas of winter, though a soft scarf and sturdy shoes are advised to ward off the evening chill. As the days shift towards the promise of spring, this night provides a reminder of nature\u2019s grip, urging us to cherish moments of tranquility before the vibrant energy of the season returns.",
