    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, the sky unfurls its cerulean canvas, presenting a scene that invites the heart into the cool embrace of a March day. There is a promise of brightness, the sort that brushes the landscape with clarity and invites wanderers into the world beyond their windows. With temperatures poised near sixty, the air carries a gentle warmth, stirred by southwest winds that playfully weave through the streets, whispering secrets of spring\u2019s approach. The moment, still young, hints at the fulfillment of longed-for adventures, as the bright horizon beckons toward leisurely strolls along the Charles River or casual gatherings in local caf\u00e9s.\n\nAs night settles, a cool reprieve will descend, tempering the day with a low around twenty-eight. The west winds will dance among the trees, creating an atmosphere perfect for cozy layers. So, as you embrace the midday sun, consider donning a light sweater, perhaps with a scarf to wrap yourself in if you linger outdoors as evening creeps in. The natural world reawakens, inviting the observant to enjoy a walk, explore the blooming parks, or simply reflect under the vast sky, taking in the tapestry of late winter and early spring. Today\u2019s beauty offers not just a visual delight but a moment to savor in the rhythm of life that flows through this vibrant city.",
