    "weather_report": "In the embrace of this May morning, Boston awakens to a canvas of deep blues and gentle clouds, promising a day that meanders between the warmth of sunshine and the playful tease of scattered rain showers. As the clock ticks toward the afternoon, expect those showers to tiptoe through the city from one to five, casting a brief interlude over the otherwise bright and partly sunny backdrop, where temperatures will flirt with the comfortable 70s. A west wind dances through the streets, lively yet composed, whispering stories of joy to all who step outside. \n\nAs clouds gather fashionably overhead tonight, the temperature will sink to a mild 54, inviting a light jacket or sweater to wrap around your shoulders as you stroll through the city's lively streets or settle into a cozy corner of your favorite caf\u00e9. For today\u2019s activities, consider wandering through the historic neighborhoods, perhaps peeking into a local bookshop or enjoying a leisurely lunch al fresco, where the charm of the city and those intermittent raindrops create a unique ambiance. As dusk approaches and the clouds usher in a serene evening, the city will settle into a restful quiet, an invitation to reflect and recharge.",
