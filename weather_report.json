    "weather_report": "The morning light casts a gentle glow over Boston, as the day unfurls its promises beneath a sky of exuberant blue. With temperatures rising towards a warm 85 degrees, a soft southwest breeze carries with it the scent of warmth and possibility, stirring the leaves and inviting activity. This blissful weather bodes well for outdoor endeavors, making it a delightful day for a leisurely walk along the Charles River. Perhaps you might find yourself weaving through the winding paths, pausing occasionally to admire the bursts of greenery, or perhaps indulging in the simple pleasure of a good book on a sun-drenched bench.\n\nAs the sun descends, the evening promises a mild embrace with temperatures falling softly to around 68, carrying a hint of warmth that lingers in the air. This would be an opportune moment for a casual dinner outdoors, perhaps at a favorite eatery with sidewalk seating, where laughter and clinking glasses resonate in the twilight. Modest attire would be advised\u2014consider light fabrics during the day, maybe a breezy top or comfortable shorts, transitioning to a light sweater as night nudges in. The hour is ripe for engaging with the vibrancy of the city, making this day a canvas for enjoyment, exploration, and the quiet radiance of summer.",
