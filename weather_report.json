    "weather_report": "In Boston, the night wears a heavy cloak of clouds, murmuring promises of chilly reprieve as temperatures dip to a brisk 21 degrees. As dawn approaches, a gentle north wind rustles through the silence, adding a whisper of winter to the air. The sky remains layered in gray, indeterminate and moody, casting an uncertain spell over the waking city. \n\nAs Sunday unfurls, the forecast predicts a continuation of this nebulous tranquility, with temperatures reaching a somewhat somber high of 37 degrees. The northeastern breeze lends an edge to the atmosphere as clouds hang densely overhead, creating a canvas of muted tones that soften the contours of the day. A dull light filters through, offering just enough clarity to hint at the shadows of buildings and streets below. For those venturing out, a warm coat layered over a comfortable sweater is advisable, perhaps paired with a knitted scarf to guard against the nipping air. The day's spirit calls for quiet domestic pursuits; a stroll through the less-traveled parks or a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9 would suit well, the warmth of a cup of coffee in hand serving as the perfect companion to the contemplative mood of this cool, gray Sunday.",
