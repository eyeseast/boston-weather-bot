    "weather_report": "The stillness of night envelops Boston as we drift into the early hours, the atmosphere heavy with the promise of moisture and the lingering warmth of an unusually humid twilight. A veil of patchy fog dances over the landscape, whispering hints of a slight chance of rain, particularly between four and five in the morning. The air is thick and clouded, foreshadowing a day that speaks of storms and humidity\u2014a prelude to an unfolding drama where the sun's later ascendance will provide a warm yet stormy embrace.\n\nAs dawn approaches, Thursday brings the likelihood of tumultuous showers and thunderstorms, with anticipation building for the day's events. The heat will rise to a brooding high, almost teasing the boundaries of comfort before falling into a gentler afternoon reprieve. Given the volatile nature of the day, dressing in layers will be wise; think light fabrics that can transition from sultry warmth to the coolness of impending rain. Venture into the day with a sturdy umbrella and perhaps a windbreaker, suitable for unexpected bursts of nature's fury. With such dramatic weather painted on the canvas of your horizon, a stroll along the winding paths by the Charles River could offer tranquility amid the brewing excitement. Or perhaps embrace the localized charm of a coffee shop, where you can watch the world stir awake, safely nestled with warmth in hand.",
