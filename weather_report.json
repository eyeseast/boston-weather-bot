    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Boston, a muted veil of clouds hangs over the city, promising rain in the still hours of the night. The air, crisp yet damp, hovers around a cool 37 degrees, making it an ideal time for flannel shirts layered beneath cozy jackets. Those venturing out should prepare for the dampness ahead, readying umbrellas to brace against the impending drizzle that will arrive post-3 a.m., with a gentle northwest breeze weaving through the streets.\n\nThe dawn will greet Bostonians with a symphony of rain and patchy fog, wrapping the city in an ethereal blanket until the afternoon. A high of 41 degrees will keep the chill persistent, so it\u2019s wise to don practical footwear for those slipping through puddles in the early light. If one must venture outdoors, a stroll through the wet streets might inspire a contemplative pause, perhaps to enjoy a warm cup of coffee while watching the umbrellas dot the thoroughfare. This day feels like an invitation to linger indoors, perhaps nestled in a favorite caf\u00e9 or pursuing the charm of a local bookstore, the rhythmic patter of rain on windows creating a soothing backdrop for a cozy retreat from the elements.",
