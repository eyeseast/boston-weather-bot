    "weather_report": "As night settles over Boston, a gentle rain begins to weave its way through the streets, wrapping the city in a soft, damp embrace. The air is cool, with a hint of chill that might suggest a warm cup of tea or a cozy fire. The clouds overhead, thick and gray, seem to cradle the city, softening the outlines of buildings into muted silhouettes. The low temperature of around thirty-seven invites one to layer up\u2014perhaps a sturdy jacket, accompanied by a scarf and sturdy footwear\u2014ideal for navigating the slick sidewalks where puddles collect and reflect the muted glow of streetlights.\n\nAs the evening unfolds, the rain will persist, and visibility may be further obscured by patchy fog. For those venturing out, a stroll through one of Boston's quieter neighborhoods might reveal the beauty of the rain-soaked streets, where the scent of damp earth and lilac mingles with the faint sounds of laughter from nearby caf\u00e9s. The forecast hints at a notion of respite from the rain tomorrow, with the possibility of sun peering through the heavy clouds intermittently. However, tonight, it is best to embrace the cozy indoor activities\u2014a good book, a lovely meal, or simply enjoying the rhythmic sounds of rain against the window as the city slips into a peaceful slumber.",
