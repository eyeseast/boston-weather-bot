    "weather_report": "As the early hours of the morning settle over Boston, the city embraces an enveloping cloud cover that hangs like a soft blanket, muted and serene. The chill in the air is palpable, hinting at temperatures that will barely rise above the forties today. Winds unfurl gently from the south, creating an undercurrent of motion against the stillness that accompanies this wintry night. It\u2019s a moment where the glittering city lights speak of life within, while the cool, crisp air outside nudges you gently to bundle up as you prepare for the day ahead.\n\nLooking to the hours that follow, expect a continuation of this hazy, cloudy tranquility, promising a high that struggles for warmth. The feeling outside will be refreshingly brisk, yet there is an unmistakable charm in the muted tones of the day. This is the sort of weather that invites cozy gatherings indoors, perhaps at a familiar caf\u00e9 or a snug bookstore, where the world outside can be witnessed through a frost-tinted window. A good scarf and warm coat will serve you well, as one ventures forth to sip on a hot beverage, embracing a day that feels both reflective and quietly invigorating.",
