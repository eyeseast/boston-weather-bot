    "weather_report": "As the midnight hour softly envelops Boston, the air is crisp and invigorating, with a calmness that hints at the day's promise. The skies are mostly clear, and a gentle breeze meanders through the city, whispering secrets of the chilly night that has settled in, with temperatures dipping to around 28 degrees. The quiet is punctuated only by the distant hum of urban life, shimmering lights casting a warm glow against the darkness.\n\nCome dawn, the promise of a brightening morning unfolds, where the sun shall rise in glory, draping the city in a soft embrace of light. Anticipate mostly sunny skies, with temperatures gracefully ascending to near comforting 51 degrees. Such conditions invite leisurely pursuits; perhaps a serene stroll along the Charles River or a visit to a local coffee shop to savor a warm brew while watching the world slowly wake. Dressing in layers will serve you well, providing enough warmth to navigate the cool morning air before shedding the outer layer to embrace the milder afternoon. Activities reflecting the calmness of a Thursday, like exploring a quaint bookstore or enjoying a quiet afternoon at home with a good book, would harmonize beautifully with this serene and pleasant weather.",
