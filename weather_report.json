    "weather_report": "The morning brings a gentle blend of sun and soft clouds, allowing the day to awaken with a serene charm. The air, brisk yet inviting, carries hints of spring's breath, with temperatures fluttering around a comfortable mid-fifties. As the hours pass, the sky may gradually surrender to a shroud of gray, foretelling the approaching evening's rain. An easygoing breeze dances through, promising a lively day that feels both refreshing and invigorating. \n\nAs one navigates the day ahead, layering will be essential. A light jacket over a cozy sweater could provide the ideal balance against the coolness, particularly as dusk embraces the city. The prospect of rain later on adds a slight urgency to outdoor plans, inviting a walk in the park before the skies turn teary. Perhaps a visit to a favorite caf\u00e9, where one can savor a warm drink while watching the world drift by, is in order. With the charm of the day hinting at both clarity and the potential for cozy indoor activities, Boston holds its promise of pleasant moments amidst the ever-shifting tapestry of spring weather.",
