    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the early morning, Boston awakens to a blanket of patchy fog, weaving ethereal veils around the city until the sun can chase it away. With temperatures hovering around a chilly 32 degrees, the air carries a briskness that whispers of winter's embrace. The west wind, a gentle yet persistent companion, stirs the leaves and rustles the quiet streets, gusting to 21 mph. As the day begins, a promise of clarity beckons, though hidden under mostly cloudy skies.\n\nAs noon approaches, a slight chance of snow may grace the landscape, poised delicately between the hours of noon and three, although it may give way to moments of brightness and fleeting sunlight. By afternoon, temperatures will drift toward a milder 34 degrees, but the chill will remain, accentuated by the northwest winds that carry both bite and refreshment. Dressed in layers, one may find comfort in a warm coat, perhaps complemented by a sturdy scarf and gloves, layering against the sharpness of the breeze. With a touch of spontaneity, a leisurely stroll down the winding paths of the Common could evoke a sense of peace, allowing for quiet reflection or a chance encounter with the city's winter spirit. Engage in a cup of hot coffee from a local caf\u00e9, and watch the world move gently around you, the fog receding and revealing the beauty of the day ahead.",
