    "weather_report": "Boston awakens under a canvas of deep blue, where the sun weaves a golden thread through the expanse of the sky. Today promises warmth, the kind that gently nudges one to step outside and embrace the day. The air is performed with a soft whisper from the south, enhancing the gentle temperature that flirts with 78 degrees. As hours slip by, the city is likely to enjoy the kiss of light, ideal for strolls along the harbor or quiet moments in the park.\n\nBut as the day transitions into night, the mood shifts subtly, cloaking the city in a sleepy veil of clouds with a low dipping to about 59. A westward breeze stirs gently, a reminder that while the warmth may linger, the evening will call for a light layer. Casual attire will suit this day well; perhaps something breathable for the street and a sweater or scarf for when shadows lengthen and the coolness settles in. As twilight beckons, consider indulging in a quiet caf\u00e9 visit, relishing a book with a warm cup in hand or wandering through neighborhoods that glow as streetlights flicker on, creating pockets of warmth and calm.",
