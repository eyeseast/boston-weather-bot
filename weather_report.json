    "weather_report": "The afternoon unfolds in Boston under a blanket of muted clouds, shrouding the city in a cool embrace and offering little in the way of brightness. With a high temperature teasing 54 degrees, the day is poised on the edge of dampness, heralded by an east wind whispering softly at ten miles per hour. As twilight approaches, the hint of rain draws closer, promising occasional showers that could dance upon the asphalt after 1 AM. The atmosphere feels heavy but expectant, with gusts reaching up to 25 miles per hour stirring up a gentle unrest, hinting at nature\u2019s ever-present unpredictability.\n\nAs you navigate the urban tapestry, consider dressing in layers to adapt to the chill that lingers in the air; a light jacket paired with a cozy sweater could keep the brisk wind at bay. It might be a fine time to stroll through one of the city's many coffee shops, basking in the aroma of freshly brewed blends, or to find solace in the pages of a book at a local caf\u00e9, while the rain's soft patter provides a calming soundtrack. Perhaps you might entertain a brief jaunt along the Charles River, where the coolness and softness of the day can be embraced, but don\u2019t forget to keep an umbrella close at hand, just in case the clouds decide to shed their tears.",
