    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds over Boston, the skies remain mostly cloudy, wrapping the city in a muted gray embrace. The temperature teeters around a gentle 52 degrees, creating a comforting chill that beckons light layers. A soft north wind whispers through the air at about 6 to 9 mph, stirring the leaves and carrying with it a refreshing hint of autumn. While the day may not be ostentatiously bright, the city is adorned with scattered lights, offering a subtle twinkle against the encroaching dusk.\n\nLooking ahead, much of the afternoon will similarly revel in cloud cover, which, while not luminous, presents a serene backdrop perfect for a leisurely stroll through one of Boston\u2019s historic neighborhoods or perhaps a quiet moment in a local caf\u00e9, where warm drinks come alive with hearty conversations. Dress warmly, perhaps in a well-loved cotton sweater paired with a light jacket, to fully enjoy the outdoor air without the bite. As the evening deepens, wrapping yourself in cozy layers will lend comfort to any after-dinner wander, allowing you to soak in the sights and sounds of the city under the muted glow of streetlights.",
