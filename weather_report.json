    "weather_report": "As night blankets Boston, the city is cast in hues of darkness, mercifully pierced by scattered lights that flicker like distant stars. The chill in the air bites, reminding all who venture outdoors to bundle up against the chill which, with gusts swirling from the west, can feel even more frigid. With temperatures hovering near ten degrees, the wind carries an icy breath, whispering promises of a cold night ahead. The sky remains mostly clear, offering an occasional glimpse of stars, though the cold winds create a sense of solitude against the urban tapestry below.\n\nAs dawn approaches, Boston will awaken to a sunny embrace, albeit still shivering under a high that will barely reach the upper twenties. The brightness will contrast with the lingering cold, painting a scene that feels both inviting and frosty. For those contemplating how to dress for the day, layering will be paramount\u2014think thick jackets, knitted hats, and sturdy gloves for comfort against the wind chill. This is a day for a brisk walk along the Charles River, where the serene surroundings provide a moment of reflection against the day's potential. One might also find solace in a warm cup from a local caf\u00e9, savoring every sip while soaking in the sunlight's fleeting warmth.",
