    "weather_report": "As dusk gently envelops Boston, the air carries a cool whisper, hinting at the haze that will soon give way to patchy fog later this evening. The clouds drift lazily across the sky, cloaking the city in a muted gray palette that reflects the tranquil spirit of the night. As temperatures dip toward the mid-fifties, the East wind contributes a gentle touch, barely ruffling the leaves and nudging you to reach for a light jacket. The anticipation of minimal rain showers looms like a shadow\u2014subdued yet present, with the chance of a drop here and there.\n\nCome morning, the clouds will linger, and those soft whispers of rain might find their way into the day. While the high will inch toward a comforting sixty-seven, it\u2019s a day best suited for curling up in a cozy caf\u00e9 with a book, wandering through a local market, or taking a stroll along the waterfront, where the fresh air mingles with the distant sounds of the city waking up. Dress in layers; with warmth lingering in the morning chill and the sun's embrace coming gradually, you will find comfort in preparation. It\u2019s an unhurried day, inviting you to savor simple pleasures in this quiet, misty embrace.",
