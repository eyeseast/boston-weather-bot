    "weather_report": "As the evening descends on Boston, a delicate veil of patchy fog softens the edges of the city. The night is cloaked in a stillness, with only the gentle hum of the southeast wind gracing the air. The temperature hovers around a cool 40 degrees, inviting a sense of introspection as you contemplate the day's tasks. With a slight chance of rain lurking in the shadows, it would be wise to wear layers\u2014perhaps a snug sweater beneath a warm jacket, paired with comfortable shoes for traversing uneven sidewalks should you find yourself wandering the dimly lit streets.\n\nLooking toward the dawn of Monday, expect the fog to roll back, yielding to a richer tapestry of clouds that could herald a chance of rain. The promise of a high near 65 degrees floats in the air, whispered by the brisk southwest winds that may gust rather fiercely. This transitional weather encourages a stroll through city parks or a languid visit to your favorite caf\u00e9 for a cup of coffee, even as clouds gather overhead. It's a day best spent draped in light fabrics, perhaps a windbreaker to fend off the chill or a scarf that can be adjusted as the temperature fluctuates. While the day carries a certain uncertainty, it also holds the promise of quiet pleasures found in mundane moments, be it a leisurely read in a cozy corner or a chance encounter with a friend amidst the rhythm of everyday life.",
