    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Boston, the sky wears a cloak of clouds, casting a twilight hue over the city. Isolated rain showers are making their way out, leaving behind a gentle chill that threads through the air. With temperatures dipping to near 24 degrees, this night holds a crispness that speaks of winter's steadfast presence. Those venturing outdoors should bundle up, a sturdy coat paired with gloves and a warm scarf, for the west wind will remind you of its gentle but persistent gusts.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the sun will peek through the clouds, promising a bright interlude with temperatures rising to just around 32 degrees. The mix of partly sunny skies and playful gusts invites one to step outside, perhaps for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River or a visit to one of the local caf\u00e9s where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee warms the heart. Embrace the day with a spirit of adventure, while being prepared for the cool air that will cling to you, a constant reminder of winter's chill lingering just beyond the warmth of hospitality.",
