Today's high tempers at just shy of 45, a gentle reminder that winter is inching closer. The northeast wind, barely noticeable at 3 mph, offers little relief from the crispness that lingers. As evening approaches, the promise of patchy fog emerges after a turning point at 4 am, mingling with partly cloudy skies that will settle into a low of around 29\u2014a nippy embrace that beckons you to prepare for a cooler night.\n\nThose venturing outside might consider layers\u2014a cozy sweater beneath a light jacket, just enough to guard against the chill while remaining comfortable during brief walks. With the afternoon sky casting a muted light, there is an invitation to linger in the warmth of a caf\u00e9, sipping on a warm beverage while enjoying the rhythm of life bustling by outside. Alternatively, a practical nature walk might reveal the exquisite details of a landscape stripped of its autumnal finery yet still teeming with its own quiet beauty. Here, nature offers a gentle retreat, encouraging contemplation under the watchful gaze of the clouds.",
