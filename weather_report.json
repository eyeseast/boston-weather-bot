    "weather_report": "As the evening draws near in Boston, the warm remnants of a summer day linger in the air, gently mingling with the whisper of a south breeze. The sky, adorned with faint streaks of pink and orange, hints at a splendid transition from day to night. Currently, the temperature sits comfortably high, nudging towards the warm embrace of 89 degrees, a reminder that summer is still in full swing even as the hour grows late. Yet, just beyond this moment of tranquility lies the promise of scattered rain showers, creeping in on tendrils of fog expected to weave their way through the city by early morning.\n\nFor those stepping out tonight, consider a lightweight layer to ward off the coolness that often follows sunset. The hint of humidity, together with the 30% chance of light rain, suggests that a carefree stroll may soon turn cloudy and damp. One might find solace in the cozy corners of a local caf\u00e9, perhaps cradling a warm drink as the world outside mellows into the soft glow of evening. While the fog will be fleeting, allowing the city\u2019s nighttime allure to shine through, it is also the perfect backdrop for a quiet walk along the riverbanks, where the shimmering lights reflect off the water\u2019s surface, conjuring an atmosphere of peaceful contemplation.",
