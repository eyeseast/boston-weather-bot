    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, the air hangs thick with moisture, cloaked in an enveloping blanket of clouds. Rain showers are persistent, casting a somber hue over the city and ushering in a sense of quiet introspection. The gentle patter of raindrops against window panes is both a lullaby and a reminder of the day's cool embrace. With temperatures sliding towards a softer 61 degrees, an east wind stirs just enough to remind you that the warmth of summer is now a memory, painting this afternoon with the color of the coming fall.\n\nAs evening approaches, the likelihood of patchy fog lingers, enhancing the clandestine nature of the urban landscape. Thoughts of strolling through the rain-drenched streets transform into whispers of cozy corners, where one might find solace in a steaming cup of tea or the rich aroma of coffee wafting through an intimate caf\u00e9. To navigate this damp scenery, layering is wise\u2014think light sweaters beneath a waterproof jacket, perhaps even a comfortable scarf. The allure of the indoors calls; it may be an opportune time for a visit to a local gallery or a quiet evening curled up with a beloved book, listening to the rain orchestrate its symphony outside.",
