    "weather_report": "As the early hours of dawn envelop Boston, the gentle embrace of a partly cloudy sky offers a hint of what\u2019s to come. The night has retreated, leaving behind a serene atmosphere defined by a cool, crisp breeze. You might find a comfortable layer quite inviting as the temperatures rest around a mild 57 degrees. This delicate transition invites morning rituals\u2014perhaps a warm cup of coffee on a quiet stoop, allowing the awakening city to unfold in whispers and distant echoes.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the clouds to part momentarily, revealing patches of blue while scattered rain showers creep in between noon and the late afternoon. There\u2019s a 40% chance of rain, which may bring with it a few rumbles of thunder, turning the tranquil ambiance into a symphony of nature\u2019s unpredictability. Dress in layers with a light jacket ready at hand, and consider waterproof footwear if you're venturing outside; a spontaneity to leap into a caf\u00e9 or wardrobe change may very well suit the day\u2019s rhythm. Given these conditions, a stroll through the Boston Common could be delightfully meandering, perhaps punctuated by a visit to a gallery or a quiet corner of a park, enjoying the fleeting moments of sunlight before the skies shift again.",
