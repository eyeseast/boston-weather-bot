    "weather_report": "As the quiet of nighttime deepens over Boston, an enveloping softness settles in. The air carries a whisper of warmth, the kind that hints at the humid embrace of summer. The gentle stirrings of the southwest wind playfully tease the remnants of the day, making it a comfortable, albeit slightly muggy, passage into the dawn hours. Sleepy city lights blink like distant stars, softly illuminating the horizon, while the atmosphere remains mostly cloudy\u2014a shroud suggesting the potential for a few unsettled moments ahead.\n\nAs Thursday unfolds, the day brings the promise of warmth and a touch of drama. With a high nearing 87, you'll want to embrace light, breathable fabrics. A simple t-shirt and airy shorts could serve you well, perhaps layered with a light jacket for those moments when a refreshing breeze sweeps through. Keep an eye on the sky, as the afternoon may introduce sporadic showers and thunderstorms, the air charged with vitality. The forecast invites a sense of adventure; perhaps meandering through a local caf\u00e9, sipping on an iced coffee, or relocating to a shaded park bench to savor a good book could be in the cards. Just remember, while the weather may keep you on your toes, Boston's charm remains steadfastly inviting, ever ready for a leisurely day of exploration amidst its storied streets.",
