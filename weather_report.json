    "weather_report": "As dawn nudges the horizon, a solemn blanket of clouds envelops Boston, cloaking the city in a muted luminescence. The air is heavy with the promise of rain, a persistent drizzle that will soon dance upon the streets. With temperatures lingering in the mid-forties and a gusty south wind weaving through the buildings, it\u2019s a day where umbrellas will become essential companions. The visuals evoke an atmosphere of cozy contemplation, perhaps inviting one to sip a warm coffee while watching the world go by through a window.\n\nAs the hours pass, expect the rain to persist, likely tapering off by evening, replaced by a lingering veil of fog that may shroud the city in mystique. It would be wise to don layers today: a comfortable sweater beneath a water-resistant jacket, perhaps paired with sturdy boots to navigate the anticipated puddles. As for activities, today is perfect for quiet errands, meandering through tucked-away shops that feel less hectic on dreary days, or engaging in creative pursuits at home, writing or painting as the raindrops provide a soft, rhythmic backdrop.",
