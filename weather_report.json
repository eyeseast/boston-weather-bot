    "weather_report": "In Boston, the afternoon unfolds with the promise of warmth, a tender embrace of summer lingering in the air. Partly sunny skies render a golden hue over the city, though there is a hint of humidity that keeps one attuned to the possibility of showers or even a fleeting thunderstorm. The temperature has nudged close to 90, while the heat index makes it feel a touch more oppressive, reminiscent of warm days in July where the sun seems to linger a little longer. You might feel the gusts of southwest wind, a gentle reminder of nature's presence, occasionally rustling the leaves.\n\nAs evening approaches, the ambiance shifts. The sun begins its descent, and the clouds gather more tightly, wrapping hints of moisture into the air. The forecast suggests chances of rain, albeit slim, before nightfall, accompanied by temperatures settling around a mild 70 degrees. The sky may not yield a brilliant sunset, but the clouds will catch the fading light, offering a muted spectacle. The night, while comfortably warm, invites a choice of attire\u2014light layers would be wise, with perhaps a soft sweater or shawl in case the evening cools unexpectedly. Consider a stroll along the waterfront or popping into a cozy caf\u00e9, where the soft hum of conversation and clinking cups create an intimate setting against the backdrop of the city. Tonight promises a simple pleasure, a moment to relish in the slow passage of a summer evening.",
