    "weather_report": "Boston awakens under a veil of patchy fog, a gentle shroud that hangs across the landscape, muffling the sounds of the awakening city. The warmth of the night lingers, with temperatures gradually rising to embrace the morning at around 51 degrees. As day breaks softly, the clouds, like wandering thoughts, float in a muted sky. By midday, the fog will recede, giving way to a high near 66, as a south wind begins to weave through the streets, picking up strength and breath. \n\nIn this brisk transition, it would be wise to don layers: a light sweater or jacket to chase away the morning chill, coupled with comfortable fabrics to enjoy the gentle warmth of the afternoon sun. As the winds pick up, consider a stroll along the Charles River, where the light shimmering on the water invites moments of quiet reflection. Alternatively, find comfort in a local caf\u00e9, sipping a warm brew while watching the city pulse with the rhythm of life, each person carrying their own story into the day. The beauty of this Sunday lies not only in the weather's fickle dance but in the simple pleasures it encourages.",
