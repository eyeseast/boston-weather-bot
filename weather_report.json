    "weather_report": "As the hours of the night slip away in Boston, a profound stillness envelops the city. The skies remain mostly clear, reflecting the tranquil chill of 13 degrees with wind chill dipping further, whispering down to a biting -5. There\u2019s a palpable energy in the air, the west wind howling gently at 21 mph, occasionally gusting with a rambunctious spirit, stirring distant lights and the willowy branches of the bare trees. In the quiet moments before dawn, one can sense the promise of a sunny day breaking on the horizon, though it will carry the persistent coolness of the night.\n\nCome morning, the sun will rise over the skyline, casting warm light on the frost-kissed world. The expected high of 23 degrees may beckon activity, yet one should be keenly aware of the wind, which will dance at 21 to 25 mph. Such conditions call for layers\u2014perhaps a heavy coat, a knitted scarf, and sturdy boots to navigate the bracing chill. A stroll along the Charles River might be in order, where the water reflects both the clear azure of the sky and the crispness of winter's embrace. Alternatively, the charm of a local caf\u00e9 awaits, offering warm brews where you can linger, contemplating the life of the city as it stirs awake from its slumber.",
