    "weather_report": "As evening draws near, the skies over Boston wear a cloak of somber clouds, casting a muted light across the city and blending the sounds of the day into the gentle hush of twilight. Tonight, expect the temperature to dip to a comfortable 56 degrees, with a westward breeze whispering softly at about five miles per hour, reminding us of the day just past. The atmosphere feels contemplative, perhaps a touch heavy, yet there\u2019s a peculiar beauty in the impending calm of the night.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, Boston may awaken under a similar shroud of clouds, with a gentle chance of rain showers lingering throughout the day. As the hours unfold, temperatures are likely to peak around 75, and though the southwest wind will offer mild relief, there is a palpable sense of unpredictability in the air. For those venturing out, layering becomes essential; a light jacket or a cardigan will guard against the coolness of the morning, while a sturdy umbrella might serve as a trusty companion for the inevitable showers. \n\nFor the soft souls who find joy in simple endeavors, a visit to a local caf\u00e9 could be the order of the day, where you can pluck a book from your satchel and lose yourself in its pages as the rain patters softly on the window. Alternatively, an afternoon stroll through the cobblestone streets might reveal the charming remnants of the day's bustle, with the scent of wet earth mingling with the lingering aroma of blooming flowers.",
