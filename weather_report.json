    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the early morning hours, Boston rests beneath a gently unfolding sky. The air feels crisp and refreshing, a promise of the warmth to come as twilight yields to daylight. With clear visibility, the city is poised for an auspicious day ahead, where sunlight will gradually paint its streets in hues of gold. By midday, temperatures will rise, transforming the atmosphere into a balmy embrace as the mercury approaches a cozy warmth that beckons for outdoor exploration.\n\nAs you step outside into this promising day, consider layers that you can easily peel away. A light shirt paired with breathable trousers will serve you well, complemented perhaps by comfortable sneakers for roaming the vibrant streets. The city invites you to stroll along the harbor or perhaps bask in the beauty of its sprawling parks, where the soft rustling of leaves will accompany your thoughts. Given the warm embrace of the sun and the gentle southwest breeze that dances through the air, it's an opportune moment to indulge in a leisurely cup of coffee on a caf\u00e9 patio or a quiet reading nook in the park, absorbing the simple joys the day has to offer.",
