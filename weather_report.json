    "weather_report": "As the clock approaches the dawn hour, Boston rests beneath a thick veil of clouds. It\u2019s a night where the promise of rain hangs palpably in the air, a precursor to the wet day ahead. The temperature lingers delicately in the cool embrace of 57 degrees, accompanied by a gentle southward breeze whispering at around 10 mph. The night offers a slight chance of rain, but those in the know may sense that the clouds are gathering their strength for a more defiant display come morning.\n\nAs you awaken to Saturday, the city will be draped in a watery shroud, with rain expected to tumble down before lunch, giving way to intermittent showers throughout the afternoon. With a high of 63, embrace the embrace of light layers, perhaps a water-resistant jacket paired with sturdy footwear\u2014pragmatic choices for a day best spent indoors. While the gusts may reach up to 30 mph, gently rustling leaves and hinting at the wildness of the weather, consider cozying up in a warm caf\u00e9, curling with a good book, or sinking into conversation with friends over hot beverages. It may not be a sun-soaked Saturday, but even the playful patter of rain outside can create a soothing backdrop for simple pleasures.",
