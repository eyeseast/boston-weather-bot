    "weather_report": "As dusk settles gently on Boston, a tapestry of mostly cloudy skies drapes across the city, casting the late evening in a muted yet calming light. The temperature lingers at a comfortable 66 degrees, where a subtle northeast breeze weaves through the air, offering a hint of refreshment. This evening is marked by a serene quietness, promising a night that feels both tranquil and inviting, yet with the lingering anticipation of possible rain showers on the morrow. \n\nTomorrow, the atmosphere suggests a gentle cloud cover, accompanied by the faintest chance of a sprinkle in the late afternoon. As the day unfolds, the air will warm to a mild 71 degrees, cloaked in a haze whispering of summer's persistence. As you navigate the day ahead, a light jacket or a cozy sweater might accompany you well, should the clouds release their delicate moisture. Engaging in leisurely strolls along the Charles River, visiting a local caf\u00e9 for a soothing cup of coffee, or simply taking the time to indulge in a good book at a nearby park would suit the ambiance, letting you savor the subtle beauty of a summer evening in the city.",
