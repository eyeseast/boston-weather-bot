    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Boston, a serene clarity blankets the city, punctuated by the flickering lights of its skyline, a comforting constellation against the darkened sky. Tonight, temperatures gently plunge to a chill reminiscent of early autumn, lingering around 42 degrees, with a gentle wind whispering from the west. Such conditions invite the haven of a cozy sweater or a layered jacket, urging locals to embrace warmth while stepping outside for an evening stroll or simply enjoying the brisk air.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the promise of a sunny day unfurls with hints of blue peeking through, though clouds may whisk in for the afternoon. The day will greet us with a mild high near 64, yet the temperature is likely to retreat gracefully into the mid-50s as the sun descends. A steady west wind may raise a playful gust now and then, setting the scene for a delightful day to wander along the Charles or perhaps linger in the parks, where the colorful foliage remains a feast for the eyes. In this gentle embrace of cool weather, one might revel in the simple joy of a hot cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9, or lose oneself in the pages of a good book, both activities perfectly attuned to the rhythm of this blissful November day.",
