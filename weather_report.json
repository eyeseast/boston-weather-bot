    "weather_report": "Tonight in Boston, the rain falls steadily, shrouding the streets in a melancholy embrace. The air, cool and damp, carries a faint chill that settles into the bones. As you navigate this weather, the cloud-laden sky casts a darkened pall over the city, broken only by the occasional glimmers of light reflecting off the wet pavement. With gusts that rattle the branches, a wind whispers through, hinting at the winter to come.\n\nTomorrow carries a promise of more rain, interspersed with patches of fog that will cloak the morning in mystery. The temperatures will struggle to rise, leaving the day feeling more like an early winter than a late fall. As you step out, consider layering up wisely; a sturdy jacket and waterproof boots will serve well against the persistent drizzle and biting winds. Equip yourself with an umbrella and a hat to shield against both rain and unpredictable gusts. It\u2019s a day best suited for indoors\u2014perhaps visiting a local caf\u00e9 with a steaming cup of something warm or wandering through a cozy bookstore, escaping the dampness outside. A stroll by the harbor, although inviting, may be less appealing; the fog could obscure the distant skyline, turning familiar views into shadowy silhouettes.",
