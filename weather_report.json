    "weather_report": "Boston greets us today with a mixture of warmth and a whisper of uncertainty, as the sun peeks through the delicate veil of clouds that drapes the sky. With temperatures hovering near 80 degrees and a light breeze rustling through the streets, it presents an atmosphere both inviting and contemplative. Yet, as the sun begins to lower, a slight chance of showers and thunderstorms dances on the horizon, teasing what might soon blur the line between the day and the night with patchy fog. The low tonight will wrap around 58 degrees, providing a serene coolness that beckons for cozy layers as you step out in the evening.\n\nAs the afternoon unfolds, consider embracing the mild warmth with breathable fabrics; a light shirt and perhaps a comfortable pair of trousers will suit the day beautifully. With the weather's fickle nature, it might also be wise to carry a light jacket or a flexible umbrella, just in case those faint raindrops decide to join the scenery. As you meander through the city streets, this is the perfect moment to stroll through one of Boston's quieter parks or enjoy a leisurely coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, savoring the gentle sways of spring while the day still shines its warm light.",
