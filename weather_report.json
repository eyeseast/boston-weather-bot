    "weather_report": "In the quiet embrace of a Boston night, the air carries a crispness that speaks of the approaching dawn. The sky is mostly clear overhead, but there is a whisper of chill as it dips to a comfortable low around 45. A gentle north wind stirs, barely perceptible, inviting a light jacket for those strolling along the familiar streets. \n\nAs morning light creeps in, Thursday holds the promise of warmth and brightness, with the sun casting its rays over the city before the haze of later hours settles in. Expect a gentle wave of comfort, inviting you to leave the heavier layers behind as the day offers a pleasant high near 70. The southeast wind brings soft breaths of air, perfect for a leisurely morning coffee at your favorite caf\u00e9 or a quiet walk in a nearby park. Consider wandering through the historic neighborhoods, where blossoms will nod gently, reminding us of the season\u2019s vibrancy. Embrace the outdoors; perhaps visit a local art exhibit or take a bike ride along the Charles before the evening haze cloaks the city, allowing for a quiet yet beautiful reflection on the day as it softens towards night.",
