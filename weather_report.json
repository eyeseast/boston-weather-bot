    "weather_report": "In Boston, the afternoon unfolds with a warm embrace, the sun shining brightly overhead, inviting many to savor the balmy air that promises a high near 86 degrees. A gentle southeast breeze, at times barely perceptible, whispers through the trees, providing a welcome respite from the heat. As the day stretches into evening, clear skies will prevail, allowing the golden tones of sunset to paint the horizon in soft hues, as temperatures settle to a comfortable 68 degrees.\n\nThe day\u2019s charm suggests a light and carefree attire; perhaps a breathable cotton shirt paired with shorts or an airy dress. As dusk approaches, consider layering with a light cardigan or a shawl. The beauty of the afternoon is best appreciated outdoors, perhaps on a leisurely stroll along the Seaport, where the warm pavement basks in the fading sunlight, or with a quiet moment in one of the neighborhood parks, watching as the world slowly transforms as day minds its way into night. A visit to a caf\u00e9, where one can sip an iced herbal tea or enjoy a light snack while absorbing the day's remaining warmth, might also serve as the perfect companion to this lovely Boston afternoon.",
