    "weather_report": "In Boston, the afternoon unfolds beneath a canvas of gently drifting clouds, with the sun illuminating the city in warm hues. As the temperature hovers around a pleasant 83 degrees, a soft northwest breeze whispers through the streets, inviting residents outdoors. The clarity of the day is refreshing, with an unobstructed view of the horizon, promising a delightful evening ahead. As the sun dips lower, it will yield to an equally inviting night, where the warmth settles to around 60 degrees, perfect for evening strolls under the stars.\n\nFor those wandering the vibrant sidewalks or lounging in the parks, light layers will suffice; a comfortable T-shirt paired with breathable shorts or a casual dress may be just the ticket. As twilight approaches, a light sweater or jacket could offer solace against the gentle coolness of the evening air. Consider meandering to a local caf\u00e9 for a late afternoon iced coffee or perhaps a leisurely visit to the waterfront, where the gentle lapping of waves offers a calming soundtrack to an afternoon well spent. Embrace the moments that this beautiful day has to offer, and let the spirit of summer linger long into the night.",
