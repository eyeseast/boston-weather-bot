    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Boston, a gentle calm settles in. The skies are mostly clear, revealing the cool air that heralds the early hours. With temperatures dipping to a serene 34 degrees, there\u2019s a quiet stillness, punctuated by the soft rustle of the wind, coaxing one to linger beneath a blanket or savor a warm drink. \n\nTomorrow promises to unfold splendidly, as golden rays of sunshine pierce through the past night's chill, ushering in a delightful high near 65 degrees. A light southwest wind will weave through the streets, making it an ideal day to venture outdoors. It would be wise to dress in layers; a light jacket or sweater will serve well in the morn, easily shed as the warmth of midday envelops the town. Imagine strolling along the Charles, or perhaps visiting one of Boston's charming caf\u00e9s, soaking in the vibrant energy that blooms with the arrival of spring. Activities like a leisurely walk through the Public Garden or a quiet moment at a local bookstore beckon, offering chances to appreciate the day's simple yet profound joys.",
