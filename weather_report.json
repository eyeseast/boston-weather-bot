    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, the sky takes on a characteristic blend of soft gray and fleeting patches of sun. Rain showers and the promise of thunderstorms weave their way through the city, creating a charged atmosphere that is both invigorating and a tad foreboding. With temperatures hovering around the pleasant 76 degrees, the warmth is coupled with the brisk caress of a southwest breeze, rustling leaves and beckoning one to step outside\u2014albeit cautiously, as the forecast hints at an 80% chance of rain later in the evening.\n\nFor those contemplating their attire, it would be wise to don a light, breathable layer paired with water-resistant footwear; the impending showers could dampen even the most spirited of excursions. With the clouds casting a gentle shadow, the day offers an ideal backdrop for a cozy caf\u00e9 visit or perhaps a stroll through the nearly empty streets, where the scent of rain mingles with fresh coffee. As dusk approaches, the clouds may bring a curtain of much-needed moisture, so securing a favorite book and settling in for the evening, with the rhythmic tapping of rain as your soundtrack, might just be the perfect way to embrace this West End symphony of nature's temperament.",
