    "weather_report": "Boston basks in a gentle embrace of afternoon sun, with a warm breeze whispering through the streets. The sky, dotted with vibrant clouds, presents a tapestry of whites against a backdrop of deep azure, making it an enchanting day for outdoor pursuits. As the temperature hovers near a comfortable 77 degrees, the warmth is inviting, yet a cheeky breeze stirs, hinting at an impending change as the night approaches. Evening brings with it a promise of slight rain showers, foretold by the shifting clouds that gather like a murmuring audience at a concert.\n\nFor those meandering through the city, a light jacket would be a thoughtful companion come twilight, as the temperature dips to a cozy 63. The atmosphere carries the subtle thrill of spontaneous plans; perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Esplanade, or a quiet read at a caf\u00e9 where the hum of conversation mingles pleasantly with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. As twilight approaches, the likelihood of rain is slight, rendering this a moment best seized with a relaxed spirit, while the setting sun casts its warm glow over the historic bricks and contemporary glass of Boston.",
