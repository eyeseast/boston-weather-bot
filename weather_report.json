    "weather_report": "As night drapes its quiet blanket over Boston, there's a subtle veil of patchy fog lingering in the crisp air, whispering its presence until dawn breaks. A gentle warm wind stirs, promising to lift the chill and carry with it the prospect of an early morning drizzle. The low temperatures cradle around forty-six, nudging upwards as the night deepens, pending a effortful awakening into a brighter day filled with clouds. As these clouds gather, a faint chance of rain looms, but for now, the streets of the city remain peaceful, preparing for the soft stirrings of Sunday morning.\n\nThe dawn will bring patchy fog before giving way to a clouded day with a hint of warmth\u2014ideal for light layers that can handle the breezy gusts. Individuals might consider slipping into a comfortable cardigan or a lightweight jacket, one that can fend off the fleeting chill while allowing for a semblance of ease against the wind's playful push. Engage with your surroundings\u2014perhaps a leisurely morning stroll through the Boston Common, where the earth is fresh and alive with the whispers of spring, or indulge in a cozy caf\u00e9 where warm coffee mingles with the aromas of freshly baked pastries. Though rain might flirt with the day, it is merely a backdrop for moments filled with connection and quiet reflection.",
