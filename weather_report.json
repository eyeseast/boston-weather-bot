    "weather_report": "In Boston this afternoon, the day unfolds with the warmth of a gentle sun, casting a soft golden light across the cityscape. With temperatures nearing a comfortable 71 degrees, the air carries a light northeastern breeze, adding a refreshing touch to the otherwise still summer afternoon. The sky is predominantly clear, adorned with the occasional fluffy cloud, creating a serene backdrop that enhances the beauty of the bustling city below. As the daylight wanes, tonight promises to be equally enchanting, with the temperatures dipping to a mild 57 degrees under a clear sky, perfect for those who enjoy the calm and quiet of a starry night.\n\nGiven these idyllic conditions, it would be wise to dress in layers; perhaps a light shirt accompanied by a cozy sweater for when the evening coolness settles in. It\u2019s a perfect invitation to leisurely stroll along the waterfront, visit a local caf\u00e9 for a quiet moment with a book, or simply gather with friends for a casual outdoor dinner. It\u2019s a splendid opportunity to appreciate the understated charm of Boston, where the ambiance invites exploration, and every corner offers a new perspective.",
