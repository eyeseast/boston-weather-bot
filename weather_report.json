Expect a sunny tapestry overhead, the sun casting down its golden light, while a light breeze from the northeast rustles the leaves and carries with it the fresh scent of adventure.\n\nAs the day unfolds, consider slipping into something light but layered\u2014a comfortable cotton shirt and breathable pants will keep you cool, with perhaps a light cardigan at hand for the morning chill. With the promise of blue skies, it's an ideal time for a leisurely stroll through the winding streets of the Back Bay or perhaps a visit to the lush expanses of the Public Garden, where the swan boats might bob gracefully on the surface of the lagoon. The day's beauty invites simple pleasures\u2014sipping coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, enjoying the hum of the city as it stirs to life.",
