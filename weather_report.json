    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Boston this evening, a wintry embrace envelops the city. Snow has begun to fall, painting the streets with a soft layer of powder, casting a serene, silvery hue upon the landscape. The air is crisp and biting, with temperatures hovering around a chill-inducing 28 degrees. A gentle north wind whispers through the barren branches, as if urging you to find comfort indoors. The promise of three to five inches of snow might encourage a spontaneous evening of cozy indulgence\u2014perhaps a warm drink and a favorite book by candlelight.\n\nLooking to tomorrow, a light chance of lingering snow before mid-morning transforms the city's skyline into a muted tapestry, where visibility may dance in and out of clarity. The high will be a modest 34 degrees, shadowed by clouds and a subtle breeze from the west. It would be wise to don layers\u2014perhaps a thick wool sweater beneath a well-insulated coat\u2014with sturdy boots to navigate the slushy remnants of the snow. Given the mood of the day, consider a walk through the hushed streets, where the world feels at rest, or a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the promise of steaming drinks beckon warmth against the day's chill.",
