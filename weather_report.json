    "weather_report": "Tonight in Boston, the sky unfolds as a canvas of clarity, punctuated by a slight chill that dances around the 34-degree mark. As the evening glides on, temperatures will softly rise to embrace a comfortable 40 by the morning. The west wind, whispering gently at 8 to 13 mph, offers a refreshing touch, beckoning one to feel the crisp air against their skin. As you step outside, a light jacket layered over a warm sweater would be wise; perhaps a scarf to ward off the lingering coolness as the night embraces the city.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the dawn will greet you with a mostly sunny disposition, and a high near 45 promises a pleasantly cool day. The northeast winds might carry the occasional playful gust, just enough to remind you that while spring whispers at the edges, winter still holds onto its chill. This is an excellent opportunity for leisurely strolls, perhaps exploring Beacon Hill\u2019s cobblestone streets, or enjoying a quiet moment by the Charles River, where the sunlight casts shimmering reflections on the water. A light layer will serve well against the invigorating breeze, encouraging exploration while keeping comfort close at hand.",
