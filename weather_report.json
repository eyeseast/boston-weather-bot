    "weather_report": "The afternoon unfolds in Boston under a blanket of brilliant sunshine, each ray emphasizing the crisp clarity of the air at this winning temperature. A gentle west wind brushes by, inviting you to step outside and breathe in the invigorating chill of winter. The sky stretches above in an endless shade of blue, unmarred by clouds, providing a beautiful backdrop for a late afternoon stroll or a contemplative moment at a nearby caf\u00e9. \n\nAs evening draws near, the horizon hints at a shift, with clouds beginning to gather, signaling a drop in temperature as night falls. Those venturing out later will find the air turning brisk, and a light sweater or a medium-weight coat will suffice to fend off the creeping coolness. This evening invites a quiet gathering, perhaps a small get-together over hot drinks, or a solitary walk along the dimly lit streets, where the faint whispers of bustling city life fade into the background.",
