The atmosphere carries a hint of moisture, suggesting that a slight chance of showers and the whisper of thunderstorms may flit through the city's streets between the hours of 4 and 5 a.m. As the dawn approaches, the temperature is a balmy 70 degrees, adorned by a soft breeze that dances lightly from the south, offering a tender caress to anyone venturing out. \n\nAs Tuesday unfolds, the prospect of patchy fog may offer its own kind of mystery before the sun fully breaks free, heralding a day that can become increasingly steamy. With a high that reaches for 92 degrees and a heat index nudging it close to 99, the day promises warmth\u2014a muggy embrace that could make the evening thunderstorms feel inevitable. It would be wise to opt for light, breathable clothing and perhaps grab an umbrella, as the air will be thick with possibilities. A leisurely stroll along the Charles, a visit to the Public Garden, or simply finding a shaded spot to savor an iced coffee could turn this summer day into a delightful adventure hidden under Boston's skyline.",
