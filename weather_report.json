    "weather_report": "In the still of the night, Boston wraps itself in a blanket of tranquility, the sky revealing a scattered tapestry of stars against a deep velvet backdrop. As the evening deepens, temperatures are settling, whispering around 16 degrees, while a gentle southwest wind rustles through the streets, adding a briskness that lingers on the skin. The city hums softly, illuminated by the flickering lights of its skyline, a quiet reminder of the vibrancy that lies beneath the cool surface.\n\nAs dawn approaches, those who venture out will bask in the promise of a sunny Tuesday, where the high will climb to about a charming 24 degrees. This day, kissed by golden sunlight, invites an array of activities in the crisp air. A stroll along the Esplanade, where laughter mingles with the rustling leaves, may be just the remedy for those craving a breath of fresh air. To embrace the day comfortably, layered clothing\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater beneath a smart jacket\u2014will ensure warmth against the cool breeze, while still allowing for the sunshine to nourish the spirit. Those who prefer a more leisurely appreciation of the day might find joy in sipping a warm cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9, observing the ebb and flow of the city from a window seat.",
