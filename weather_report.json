The temperature dips to a crisp 39 degrees, with a soft northwest wind whispering through the streets, offering a tranquil hush to the urban bustle. As dawn approaches, anticipation fills the air; clouds will give way to a brilliant sun that promises to illuminate the cityscape, painting the day in warm hues and inviting spirits. With a high near 66, it\u2019s a day that beckons you to step outside and breathe freely, letting the gentle breeze sweep through your hair.\n\nFor those navigating this cool morning, layers would be wise\u2014perhaps a light jacket to fend off the chill, but as the sun ascends, donning a light shirt will suffice for the pleasant warmth that will soon arrive. Today could be perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River, where the tranquil waters reflect the awakening sun, or perhaps to visit a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring a warm cup while watching the world come to life. Whether you choose to wander through the historic streets or find solace in a park, Boston awaits with an invitation to embrace the promise of a lovely day dawning ahead.",
