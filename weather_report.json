    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Boston, a layer of patchy fog drapes the city like a soft, muted veil. The world outside has receded to shadows and glowing streetlights, creating an almost ethereal quality to the stillness. With snowflakes lingering in the air, the temperature settles around a chilly 24 degrees. A gentle southwest breeze tugs at the edges of your coat, whispering hints of winter's chill, as light snowfall threatens to coat the streets in a delicate layer\u2014though not more than a whisper of accumulation is expected. \n\nTomorrow dawns on a modest note, the promise of mostly cloudy skies reflecting a muted palette. With the mercury edging up to a conservative 37, this is a day for warmth and thoughtful layering. Consider a sturdy winter coat paired with a cozy scarf\u2014perhaps even a woolen hat\u2014to ward off the persistent chill, should the fog linger. It\u2019s a day to embrace the indoors, with the fragrance of fresh coffee filling your home as you savor a quiet morning. A stroll through a nearby park, with the crunch of snow beneath your boots, could provide a gentle reminder of nature\u2019s beauty, albeit one cloaked in fog. Or perhaps, settle in with a good book by the window, letting the world become merely a backdrop to your thoughts as the winter scene unfolds outside.",
