    "weather_report": "As night settles over Boston, a veil of rain drapes the city, whispering against windows and blurring the lines between the familiar and the unknown. The air is chill, a bite of frost hinting at the elusive warmth of the day ahead. Wisps of fog creep in, obscuring the silhouettes of familiar landmarks, creating an aura of mystery as they move softly like apparitions through the streets. From the northeast, a gentle wind carries the dampness, urging you towards a cozy embrace, perhaps a thick scarf wrapped tight around your neck, a hat to shield from the damp chill.\n\nTomorrow promises a muted palette, the sun playing coy behind a curtain of overcast sky. Patchy fog and a hint of drizzle will linger, inviting you to stroll along sheltered avenues or indulge in the comfort of a local caf\u00e9, its warmth a welcome relief from the chill outside. As you wander, be mindful that the dampness might cling to your clothes, so layering is key. A light jacket over a snug sweater, accompanied by sturdy shoes, will keep you grounded as you navigate the day. While the weather may seem dreary, find joy in small pleasures \u2013 a warm drink cradled in your hands or the company of others seeking refuge from the rain.",
