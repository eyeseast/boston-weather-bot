You can expect a clear sky adorned with a sprinkle of stars, while the wind whispers through the trees with a gentle northward pull. With temperatures dipping to a low of around 27, it will be wise to don your warmest layers\u2014a cozy sweater, perhaps a scarf, and a reliable coat to shield against the evening's bite. \n\nWednesday brings promise of a transformation. The bright sun may hover patiently before the horizon, casting its warm gaze upon a day marked by a playful flirtation with rain\u2014perhaps a light shower making an appearance after the evening rush, just as the day gives way to night. Acknowledging the slight chance of precipitation, one might consider packing an umbrella for the late afternoon jaunt, although the morning and early hours beckon with their mostly sunny splendor. As the day unfolds, indulge in a stroll along the Charles River, or perhaps visit a local caf\u00e9 to savor the warmth of a freshly brewed coffee, soaking in the evolving spring ambiance as the city awakens around you.",
