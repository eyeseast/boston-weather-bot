    "weather_report": "As Boston embraces the soft embrace of morning, the chill in the air serves as a gentle reminder that winter's grip is still reluctant to fully release its hold. Tonight's clear skies will gradually yield to a partly sunny day, bringing with it a modest warmth that may be welcomed but should still be approached with caution. The winds, playful yet persistent, will sweep through the city at a brisk pace, carrying with them the freshness of spring tempered by the lingering coolness of the night.\n\nIn this transitional period, attire should reflect a blend of practicality and comfort. Layering is key\u2014a lightweight sweater over a long-sleeve shirt, accompanied by a windbreaker to fend off the brisk gusts. A warm scarf can offer a touch of coziness while strolling through the historic streets, perhaps pausing briefly to admire the delicate choreography of leaves dancing in the wind. With the day unfurling gently before us, it\u2019s perfect for a leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9, an easy wander through the neighborhood shops, or simply enjoying a tranquil moment in one of Boston\u2019s many parks, where the signs of spring begin to awaken.",
