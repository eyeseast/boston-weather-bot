    "weather_report": "As the evening settles into Boston, a light hush cloaks the city, the air crisp with the promise of a winter chill. The tranquility is punctuated by the occasional whir of distant traffic, but mostly, it is the soft sound of night that now reigns. Clouds blanket the sky, casting shadows over the urban landscape, while the city lights shimmer like scattered jewels, a twinkling contrast to the dark canvas above. Tonight\u2019s temperature lingers around a brisk 25 degrees, with a gentle westerly breeze whispering through the streets, urging you to seek comfort and warmth.\n\nCome Sunday, expect a cheerful shift as the sun rises, breaking through the cloud cover and casting vibrant rays upon Boston. The temperature will climb to a respectable 38 degrees, inviting residents outdoors to bask in the newfound sunshine. Yet, the brisk southwest wind will remind you that winter is still in full swing. As you prepare your day, consider bundling up in layers\u2014 a warm coat, a scarf, and perhaps a sturdy pair of gloves will make your outdoor excursions much more enjoyable. With the sky painted in azure hues and the sun gracing the day, it\u2019s a perfect opportunity for a leisurely walk along the Charles River or a visit to your favorite caf\u00e9 for a warming brew. Simple pleasures await in this serene and inviting winter day.",
