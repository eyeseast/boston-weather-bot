    "weather_report": "As the night envelops Boston, a veil of patchy fog weaves through the streets, accompanied by the gentle whispers of showers and the distant rumble of thunder. The air is thick and warm, wrapping around you like a soft, damp shawl as temperatures linger in the mid-60s. A southwest breeze, gentle yet persistent, rustles the leaves of nearby trees, hinting at the promise of a new day. The world around is muted, the lights of the city glimmer through the fog like distant stars struggling to break free from the night. \n\nFriday dawns with a sigh of relief from the tempestuous night. Expect the fog to lift by morning, revealing a canvas of partially sunny skies, inviting warmth filtering through as temperatures rise to a comfortable 79 degrees. The westward winds, playful and light, carry the potential for an invigorating stroll among Boston\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods. Consider donning a breathable fabric that dances with the air, light clothing that lets your skin breathe while keeping a light jacket handy for those early hours when the remnants of fog linger. As the day unfolds, a visit to a neighborhood caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink or a leisurely exploration of local parks could offer a delightful embrace of the day\u2019s beauty while the world awakens in lazy comfort.",
