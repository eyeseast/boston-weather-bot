    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks softly over Boston, a gentle chill lingers in the air, whispering of a comfortable day ahead. The sky, a muted canvas of night slowly giving way to morning, promises a transformation into brilliance. With a low temperature from the overnight settling around 65, the world around you feels fresh and inviting, wrapped in a cloak of mild, invigorating air. The faint rustle of the northwest wind beckons, reminiscent of quiet conversations with the trees that line the city\u2019s parks.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the sun will rise higher, casting a warm glow upon the bustling streets. With a high expected near 78, the brightness will filter through the layers of the city, illuminating the charm of its architecture and the vibrancy of its life. Monday invites you to don comfortable layers\u2014perhaps a light shirt with breathable fabrics and a pair of jeans, ready for the pleasant warmth. This is a day to embrace casual outings: sip a coffee at a local caf\u00e9, stroll along the Boston Common, or even take a leisurely bike ride along the Esplanade, where the gentle undulations of the river reflect the shifting hues of the sky. Let the beauty of the day inspire simple pleasures, as the city emerges alive with possibilities.",
