    "weather_report": "As evening envelops Boston, a thick blanket of clouds hangs overhead, casting a muted veil over the skyline. The air is warm but carries the promise of rain, a subtle reminder of the dynamic nature of our New England weather. The temperature whispers around 60 degrees, with an expectation to inch upwards as night deepens. Accompanying the moisture in the air, winds from the southwest dance gently at about 13 mph, lending a gentle rustle to leaves and a tangible energy that hints at the storms to come.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Wednesday, expect the skies to weep, transitioning from showers and fog to a cacophony of thunderstorms. The day cradles an uncanny mingling of warmth and dampness, with highs close to 69 that will relinquish their grip by afternoon, drifting downward toward the more subdued numbers. Prepare for a deluge; the day promises heavy rainfall, with perhaps three-quarters to an inch spilling from the sullen clouds. Consider dressing in layers that can adapt\u2014a pair of sturdy shoes, perhaps, to navigate flooded streets, and a waterproof coat, reliable against the elements. Given the tumultuous weather and the generally gray disposition of the day, it might be wise to find solace in indoor pursuits such as diving into the pages of a good book, enjoying the warmth of a caf\u00e9, or visiting one of Boston\u2019s rich museums, where you can escape the gloom outside while the raindrops paint the city in strokes of rhythm.",
