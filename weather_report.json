    "weather_report": "In the quiet of Boston\u2019s night, a chill seeps into the still air, whispering secrets of the frosty hours to come. As you listen, the breeze brushes against the skin, carrying with it a promise of clarity and brilliance for the day ahead. The low temperatures settle around a biting three degrees, but the wind chill dances down to an even colder embrace, reminding us that warmth can sometimes be a fleeting feeling. \n\nSunday will emerge with a canvas of mostly sunny moments, as the sun\u2019s rays flicker into the scene, promising a high that meticulously approaches eighteen degrees. Beneath the cerulean sky, the brisk northwest wind, though slightly gentler than last night, reminds us to don layers, wrapped in woolen scarves and sturdy boots to command this winter day with grace. Perfect for a stroll through Boston's historical streets or perhaps a contemplative pause at a cozy caf\u00e9 tucked away from the wind. Whether you choose to roam Andrew Square or simply curl up with a warm drink, today beckons for the warmth of togetherness, wrapped in the soft glow of camaraderie and conversation.",
