    "weather_report": "As evening envelops Boston, the air grows still, carrying a whisper of impending fog that beckons softness to the edges of the skyline. Currently, the clouds, like gentle brushes on a painter's canvas, blanket the sky in muted shades of gray and blue. In the aftermath of day, the temperature gently settles around a comfortable 67 degrees, inviting a casual stroll or a quiet moment on the porch with a good book. Those venturing out this evening may want to layer lightly; a cardigan or a light sweater will add just enough warmth against the subtle chill that tiptoes in with the arrival of night.\n\nTomorrow holds promise of more warmth, as the sun rises to an estimated high near 84 degrees, though the forecast hints at scattered showers and the distant rumble of thunder. With the potential for patchy fog lingering into the early hours, the morning may offer a tranquil yet mystifying start. As the day blooms, lighter attire will suit the rising temperatures, though packing an umbrella might serve you well should a fleeting storm pass through. Such conditions, while perhaps a slight inconvenience, also offer a perfect excuse to explore the rich indoor spots Boston has to offer: a leisurely visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 or perhaps a journey through a local museum's hallowed halls. Enjoy this interlude of nature and city life, for in its quiet moments, one often finds the most profound solace.",
