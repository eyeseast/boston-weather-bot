    "weather_report": "The afternoon descends gently over Boston, cloaked in a blanket of clouds that spreads like a soft, gray quilt across the sky. Light drizzle is anticipated as the day drifts closer to the evening, lending the air a muted, refreshing chill. The temperatures hover near a cool 56 degrees, with the northeast wind whispering through the streets and tree-lined avenues, stirring the fabric of a spring day that feels more reminiscent of autumn.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect the drizzle to linger, wrapping the city in a soft embrace until the early hours of the morning. It's a perfect evening for cozy layers; a light jacket paired with a comfortable scarf will serve well against the cool breeze. Perhaps a stroll through the quieter parks, where the drips of dew meeting the earth lend a soothing rhythm, could be the ideal escape. Capture yourself momentarily lost in thought, or hole up in a charming caf\u00e9, savoring warm sips as the world outside settles into the soft drizzle. \n\nFor this tender spring evening, the clarity of the day remains cloaked but inviting, urging a gentle retreat into warmth and comfort.",
