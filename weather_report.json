    "weather_report": "As the night unfolds over Boston, a gentle blanket of clouds accompanies the brisk air, hinting at the chill that accompanies late February. The temperature, teetering around 24 degrees, offers a chilly embrace, underscored by a light southwest breeze. While the city sleeps, the soft glow of lights outlines the contours of the skyline, ethereal in its stillness.\n\nLooking ahead, Sunday promises a shift\u2014a flirtation with the sun as it peeks through the clouds, warming the air slightly to a high near 42 degrees. A westward wind, at a comfortable pace, will accompany this modest warmth, making the day suitable for a stroll through the quieter streets of Boston. Don layers, perhaps a hearty sweater accompanied by a light coat, to balance the cool air and afternoon sun. As the day unfolds, it beckons one toward simple pleasures: perhaps a leisurely walk along the Charles, the sounds of water gently lapping against the shore providing a soothing backdrop, or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 where the aroma of fresh coffee mingles with the laughter of friends. \n\nYour Sunday awaits, a canvas of potential resting between the chill of winter and the promise of spring.",
