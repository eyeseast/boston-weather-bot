    "weather_report": "As evening drapes its soft cloak over Boston, the sky presents a serene palette of muted pastels, hinting at the warm embrace of the upcoming night. The air is surprisingly mild, as the gentle whisper of a southerly breeze nudges the branches, and the comfort of a balmy low of 71 invites one to linger outdoors. Tonight's clarity promises a refreshing chance to appreciate the symphony of sounds that the city unfolds after dusk, from the distant laughter wafting across the Common to the soft rustle of leaves in the twilight air.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, Boston is set to bask in the golden warmth of an abundant sun, reaching heights nearing 97, with the humidity draping itself closely, creating a palpable heat that may even elevate the feel to a stifling 102. Such temperatures beckon a wardrobe adjustment; light, breathable fabrics will be your allies. Perhaps a leisurely stroll by the harbor or a visit to a shaded caf\u00e9 will be the day\u2019s remedy against the relentless rays, allowing one to sip iced tea while people-watching in the embrace of the afternoon sun. \n\nAs this evening deepens, it invites you to relish the pleasantness of a summer night before the heat of the morrow sets in.",
