    "weather_report": "As afternoon settles over Boston, the day unfolds with an inviting clarity, bathed in a gentle sunlight that dances across the landscape. With temperatures warming to a comfortable 61 degrees, the soft northeast breeze whispers through the streets, offering a refreshing caress. Tonight promises a tranquil transition into a cooler darkness, dropping to around 44 degrees under a sweeping expanse of mostly clear skies. This harmonious arrangement invites residents to revel in the great outdoors \u2014 perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Charles River or a quiet moment spent in one of the city's numerous parks, where the rustling leaves promise whispers of autumn.\n\nDressing for this delightful day calls for light layers; perhaps a cozy sweater to don as evening approaches, complemented by comfortable walking shoes, ideal for spontaneous moments spent wandering. Whether it\u2019s grabbing a warm coffee from a local caf\u00e9 or simply soaking in the ambiance of the city, the blend of sun and gentle air makes for an afternoon worthy of exploration and enjoyment.",
