    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Boston, the sun bathes the city under a canvas of azure, punctuated by the occasional whimsical cloud drifting lazily by. With temperatures reaching the low 80s and a brisk west wind lending a refreshing edge, it\u2019s a delightful moment to venture outside. The warmth invites a lightness to your attire; perhaps a simple cotton shirt paired with relaxed trousers will do, allowing you to stay comfortable against the gentle gusts that whistle through the streets, occasionally stirring the tree canopies with a playful shudder.\n\nAs the sun begins its descent this evening, the skies will remain mostly clear, ushering in a comfortable night further cooled by the soft breezes. With the temperature dropping to the low 60s, a light jacket or a wrap would be prudent if you\u2019re planning to stroll along the waterfront or enjoy a quiet dinner al fresco. The scene is not just pleasant; it beckons you to linger outdoors, perhaps indulging in a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or meandering through a nearby park, where the subtle sounds of nature accompany the settling dusk. The evening holds an undeniable charm, perfect for a contemplative walk or a casual gathering with friends under the stars.",
