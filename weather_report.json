    "weather_report": "As night settles over Boston, a subtle murkiness hangs in the air, enveloping the skyline with a thin veil of patchy fog. Rain and wet snow tease the atmosphere, whispering their uncertain intentions before midnight. There\u2019s a chill that bites at the edges, promising to usher in a drop to the low twenties, yet as the night trudges on, a gradual warming encourages a rise to near thirty-four. With winds softly nudging from the southwest, this feels more like a night for layered comfort than for braving the elements. Thick sweaters and jackets must be your armor, perhaps paired with a sturdy pair of boots for the likelihood of slick sidewalks.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the promise of clearer skies emerges with Thursday's awakening. Bright sunshine awaits, coaxing a high of approximately forty-two, a welcome companion heralding a shift from the night\u2019s despondency. A gentle breeze, flirting flirtatiously at eight to twelve miles per hour, will lift spirits as residents step out. The day beckons for simple joys: a stroll through the neighborhood adorned with the muted hues of winter, a stop by a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warming drink, perhaps even a visit to a local bookstore to lose oneself in stories while the sunlight casts playful shadows outside. Dress in layers, embrace the coming warmth, and savor whatever simple moments await you on this transitioning day.",
