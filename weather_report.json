    "weather_report": "In the heart of Boston today, a delicate balance of warmth and humidity paints the afternoon canvas. The sun makes its presence known through partly sunny skies, coaxing the air temperature toward a pleasant 84 degrees. The breeze from the south whispers at a brisk pace, creating momentary lifts of the spirits, though clouds cast a hint of uncertainty. As the afternoon wanes, the air grows thick with possibility, hinting at the chance of showers and thunderstorms that could grace the city post-5 PM. \n\nAs evening descends, the chances of rain intensify, ushering in cloudy skies and a significant likelihood of evening thunderstorms. A low of 58 will wrap the city in a cooler embrace, bringing with it patchy fog, creating an ethereal quality to the nighttime atmosphere. Dressing for today calls for light layering\u2014a comfortable short sleeve, paired with a light jacket for when the skies begin to darken and chill. One might consider a tranquil stroll along the waterfront as the sun dips, or perhaps stopping at a favorite caf\u00e9 to sip something warm and comforting, while listening to the murmurs of a thriving city ready to embrace the night, though one should be prepared to retreat indoors should the heavens open up.",
