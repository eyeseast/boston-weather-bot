    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Boston, a soft veil of clouds drapes the city in a muted light, casting an air of quiet contemplation. The day promises a brisk experience, with the chill of morning settling around 23 degrees. A gentle west wind stirs, rustling through the remnants of winter, but it is not harsh\u2014rather, it brings a lively energy and a sense of anticipation for what lies ahead. By afternoon, expect a transition toward partly sunny skies, encouraging those who venture outside to feel the warmth of the sun on their faces, even as it hovers around 42 degrees.\n\nFor those stepping out today, layering is the key. A warm jacket, perhaps a cozy scarf, will ensure comfort against the nipping air, while a pair of sturdy shoes will guide you through the day\u2019s pursuits. While the weather invites a stroll through the winding streets or perhaps a leisurely visit to one of the city's many cozy cafes, it also beckons for a quiet moment indoors\u2014a perfect opportunity to lose oneself in a book or enjoy the company of friends over warm beverages. Whatever your choice, the day carries a subtle charm, whispering of the promise of spring just around the corner.",
