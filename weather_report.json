    "weather_report": "In the stillness of early morning, Boston lies cloaked in a gentle shroud of darkness. The nighttime air is cool, whispering softly of the chill that lingers with a low temperature settling around forty-two degrees. As dawn inches closer, the horizon promises the murky embrace of clouds, hinting at the rain that will drench the city after the midday hour. The east wind, light but persistent, dances through the trees, stirring a sense of anticipation for the day ahead.\n\nAs the clock ticks toward late morning, prepare for the arrival of rain that will transform the landscape. This is not a day for frivolity, but rather a time to don layers that offer warmth without overwhelming weight\u2014perhaps a light jacket accompanied by a cozy scarf. The urban palette of Boston will be muted, the vibrancy drenched, and the streets slickened with the patter of raindrops that will gently erase the remnants of yesterday's sun. As the weather calls for quietude and reflection, consider venturing out with a good book to a charming caf\u00e9, a place where the aroma of brewed coffee mingles with the sound of rain tapping against the window. This day paints a picture of subdued beauty; it invites you to savor the simple pleasures of life while nestled in warmth, sheltered from the downpour.",
