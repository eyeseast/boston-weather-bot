The arrival of patchy fog after the early hours transforms the landscape, infusing it with a quiet mystery, inviting contemplation as you sip your evening tea or wander through the softly dimmed streets. Given this m\u00e9lange of weather, dressing in layers remains prudent\u2014maybe a light sweater over a simple tee, complemented by casual trousers. Tonight, whether you choose to contemplate the day\u2019s gentle ebb along a tranquil park bench or delve into a warm book at home, the evening promises a serene close.",
