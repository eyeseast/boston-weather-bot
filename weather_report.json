    "weather_report": "As the sun rises over Boston, a tapestry of blue blankets the sky, punctuated by the gentle whisper of a northeast breeze. Today, the world wakes to clarity unmarred by fog, inviting residents to step outside and embrace the cool embrace of autumn. With a high near 61, the air carries a crispness that invigorates the spirit, while the night promises to return with warmth, wrapping the city in a cozy low of around 44. \n\nTo fully enjoy this day, one might don layers, perhaps a light sweater over a long-sleeve shirt, perfect for the fleeting chill that morning brings while remaining comfortable as the sun climbs higher. It\u2019s a splendid opportunity to stroll along the Charles River, savoring the vibrant hues of fall foliage, or to linger at a cafe with a warm beverage, soaking in the serenity of an average Tuesday turned delightful. The day beckons\u2014not with flamboyance, but rather with a quiet charm that encourages simple pleasures in the heart of the city.",
