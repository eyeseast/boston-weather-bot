    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds over Boston, a veil of clouds casts a muted gray over the nightscape, the city lights twinkling softly like distant stars caught in a twilight haze. The chill lingers in the air, a gentle reminder of winter's chilly embrace, with temperatures dipping to a cool 10 degrees. The night is still, broken only by whispers of a light southwest breeze that carries the crisp scent of the season. \n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, the clouds will continue to dwell overhead, mirroring the calm yet determined atmosphere of the night. The temperature will rise slightly, reaching around 29 degrees, but the chill will remind you of winter's presence. Dressing warmly is paramount; think layers that keep the warmth close\u2014perhaps a snug woolen sweater beneath a wind-resistant jacket, topped off with a cozy scarf to ward off the frosty air. A stroll through a local park, breathing in the fresh, cold air, or an afternoon at a quaint caf\u00e9, warming your hands around a mug of hot chocolate, seems particularly inviting given the subdued ambiance and crisp air. Embrace the serenity of Boston's winter days, where the softness of the clouds meets the twinkling lights of home.",
