    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Boston, the day unfurls its thick cloak of mist, weaving an ethereal tapestry across the skyline. The air hangs heavy, carrying the promise of rain, while patches of fog shuffle through the streets like specters from a forgotten tale. With a temperature lingering in the cool embrace of the mid-fifties, the wind whispers softly\u2014a reminder of autumn's chill, gusting with moments of vigor that dance through the branches and rattle the leaves. Today\u2019s shadows are painted in muted grays, lending a somber serenity, yet beneath the clouds lies the certainty of a downpour as the evening draws near.\n\nAs the hint of dusk deepens, expect not just soft rain showers but the possibility of roaring thunderstorms threading their electric fingers through the dim veil. It is wise to don something warm and waterproof, perhaps a trusty raincoat over a cozy sweater, and to accompany the ensemble with sturdy footwear that can handle not just the rain but the wet streets that may follow. While the enchantments of the outdoors beckon, it may be a more suitable evening for quiet pursuits; consider curling up with a good book or embracing the warm aroma of a favorite beverage in the comfort of your home. The world outside may be dulled by fog, yet inside, there is peace to be found amid the storm.",
