    "weather_report": "As the afternoon gently unfolds over Boston, the heavens are shrouded in a soft, gray embrace, casting the city in a muted light. With temperatures nearing a comfortable warmth, the air carries a whisper of humidity, hinting at the interactions of clouds and sky. A light eastward breeze dances through the streets, softening the edges of the day, though the clouds linger with a promise of more than just veil-like appearances. \n\nAs twilight approaches, the atmosphere will deepen, and the fog will unfurl its tendrils through the city's quiet nooks, giving way to a chance of showers and the occasional rumble of distant thunder. Such conditions call for thoughtful attire; light layers\u2014perhaps a jacket or a cozy sweater\u2014could be wise, while waterproof shoes might guard against sudden, playful splashes from unwelcome rain. This evening's mood evokes a sense of reflection, perfect for a leisurely walk along the banks of the Charles, where one might find solace in the gentle rustling of leaves and the sophisticated dance of water against the shoreline.",
