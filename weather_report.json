    "weather_report": "As night envelops Boston, a veil of clouds blankets the city, heavy with the promise of light snow. The brisk air carries a whisper of winter, urging a retreat indoors where warmth reigns. The streets are quiet, likely to remain so as the hour creeps onward. Expect a modest accumulation of snowflakes, gentle and fleeting, unlikely to intrude too much on tomorrow's plans. When dawn breaks, the city will likely be kissed by a slight chance of rain and snow, but the sun will soon assert itself, casting a bright, cheerful light across the day. \n\nSunday holds the promise of a mostly sunny respite, with a high that beckons to those seeking solace in the fresh air, though the wind cuts sharply enough to be mindful of your layers. A light jacket may ward off the chill, ideally paired with a scarf to fend off the brisk southwest breeze. Take a leisurely stroll through the local neighborhood, allowing the simplicity of daily life to unfold before you. Perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, warming your hands around a steaming cup, would be just the antidote to a chill day.",
