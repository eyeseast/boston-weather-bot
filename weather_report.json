    "weather_report": "In the early hours of this June morning, a gentle veil of fog swathes Boston, casting a soft, muted light on the city as it stirs from sleep. The air is cool, lingering around the mid-50s, while the trees sway slightly in the light touch of a northern breeze. Fog blankets the landscape, lending an ethereal quality to the surroundings, like an old photograph that beckons you to lean closer. As day breaks, glimpses of the urban frame begin to emerge through the mist, hinting at the promise of a mostly cloudy but pleasant day ahead.\n\nAs we drift towards midday, expect the fog to dissipate by the late morning, revealing a high near 71 degrees. This atmospheric quietude invites a leisurely stroll through the Boston Common or perhaps a coffee at a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh brews mingles with the lingering dampness of the morning. Layers may be your best choice today\u2014light sweaters or long sleeves in the early hours that easily give way to a short-sleeved shirt as the warmth grows. It\u2019s a day where every step holds the potential for discovery, whether it's exploring a tucked-away bookshop or simply enjoying the company of a friend as you meander along the Charles River. A serene day is on the horizon, one that welcomes both reflection and connection in the unfolding embrace of the city.",
