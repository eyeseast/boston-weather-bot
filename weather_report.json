    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Boston, the horizon is adorned with the soft whispers of a clear sky. The city, still enveloped in the languid arms of night, signals an impending warmth when the sun breaks through. You can expect a subtle stir in the air as temperatures glide into the unyielding embrace of the mid-nineties. The gentle southwest breeze will carry with it the promise of an inviting summer day, yet the heat beckons for a touch of moderation in your choices.\n\nAs the hours roll on, consider dressing in light fabrics that dance with the wind, perhaps a loose linen shirt paired with comfortable shorts. The day offers ample opportunities for leisurely errands or serene strolls along the waterfront, where the gentle lapping of the waves serenades the busy hum of the city. A midday retreat to one of the myriad cafes\u2014where iced beverages await\u2014will allow you to savor the sweet taste of summer while escaping the more intense rays. While the sun shines bright above, the ever-approaching evening will soon usher in the coolness that follows the relentless heat of midday, inviting a reflective end to a warm summer's day.",
