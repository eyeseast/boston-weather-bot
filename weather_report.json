    "weather_report": "The morning unfurls over Boston shrouded in a thick veil of drizzling rain and peculiar fog, transforming the familiar skyline into a muted silhouette. The air is heavy, carrying the gentle scent of damp earth and the salty tang of the nearby harbor. A cool breeze whispers through the streets, offering a brisk reminder of the season as gusts touch upon twenty-five mph, stirring lingering droplets from the trees. The day beckons you to embrace the coziness of layers\u2014a sturdy raincoat and perhaps a knitted scarf to ward off the persistent chill, as the temperature hangs near forty-four, barely hinting at warmth.\n\nAs we progress toward the evening, the forecast suggests a gradual easing of the rain, but don\u2019t be misled by the softening gloom; the cloud cover remains substantial, a blanket promising to keep the chill locked in. With the mercury dropping to a low around thirty-seven, one might find solace in a warm cup of tea or coffee, the perfect companion for flipping through pages of a long-awaited book. Tonight\u2019s ambiance might inspire a quiet dinner at home or a leisurely stroll through the misty streets\u2014consider wearing waterproof footwear to navigate any puddles left by the day\u2019s dreariness. In this weather, there is a peculiar magic in the air, allowing one to pause, reflect, and appreciate the serene beauty of a rainy day in the city.",
