    "weather_report": "In the quiet morning hours of Boston, the air clings with a mild haze, a prelude to the day ahead. The fog, though teasingly present, is expected to lift, revealing a sky painted in soft, muted hues, as the sun pushes through with gentle warmth, promising a high around 80 degrees. A soft south wind whispers through the trees, inviting you to embrace the outdoor charm of the city that awaits beyond the gray veil.\n\nAs the sun starts its ascent, the afternoon beckons for leisurely strolls along the Esplanade or perhaps a visit to one of the city\u2019s peaceful parks, where the fresh scents of spring mingle with the laughter of people enjoying the day. Tonight, as the fog returns and the temperature dips to a comfortable 58 degrees, a cozy sweater or light jacket would be wise to embrace the evening chill. It\u2019s a just-right day for those who appreciate the gentle tug of nature, urging one to blend the warmth of the day with the cool caress of twilight, allowing for simple pleasures of reading outdoors or savoring a meal al fresco with friends.",
