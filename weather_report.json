    "weather_report": "As twilight falls over Boston, the air is thick with anticipation, carrying the scent of rain that is destined to transform the landscape overnight. The sky is a muted canvas, draped in a cloak of clouds, hinting at the 80% chance of showers that will soon arrive. With temperatures settling around 49 degrees, a soft breeze from the south gently whispers through the streets, adding a chill to the evening. Those venturing out might find it wise to don a light jacket and perhaps an umbrella, as the night is poised to offer a few sprightly showers just after midnight.\n\nTomorrow dawns with the promise of transition, the lingering raindrops giving way to moments of sunlight as the day unfolds. A high near 73 invites a sense of warmth, though the remnants of evening moisture may still linger. A fleeting chance of light showers gives way to partly sunny skies, perfect for a leisurely stroll in the commons or to seek refuge in a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink as a gentle wind brushes the leaves. For those inclined to explore, it may also be the perfect moment to visit a local bookstore or art gallery, relishing the blend of warmth and the rejuvenating aftermath of the rain.",
