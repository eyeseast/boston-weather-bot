    "weather_report": "As the night deepens in Boston, a blanket of clouds shrouds the city, painting an atmosphere both mysterious and tranquil. The cool air wraps around you, with temperatures sliding down to a brisk 49 degrees. A gentle northeast wind whispers through the streets, feeling almost present, as if urging the world to settle into peaceful slumber.  \n\nLooking ahead, Sunday promises to awaken with a damp embrace, as rain chances dance between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. Patchy fog may join the ensemble, casting a soft veiling over familiar sights, while the clouds linger, offering little respite. The temperature will nudge toward 60, but the gusts\u2014hitting up to 33 mph\u2014will remind you that autumn is asserting its claim. Given this forecast, dressing in layers would be wise; a light, water-resistant jacket coupled with a cozy scarf should provide comfort against both wind and moisture. Consider a gentle stroll through a nearby park as the morning greets you; the tantalizing scents of freshly fallen rain mingling with earth could make the simplest of moments feel poetic. If the day grows wetter, perhaps a nearby coffee shop, the scent of roasted beans wafting through the air, will serve as the perfect hideaway, allowing you to watch the world dance with rain.",
