    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Boston, a gentle warmth lingers in the air, hinting at the moments to come. The day starts revealing patches of sunlight, dancing playfully among the clouds, while the temperature whispers a comfortable 83 degrees. As the sun travels across the sky, you may want to enjoy the respite of a light breeze, whispering softly from the east at around six miles per hour, carrying with it a hint of the sea, a reminder of the city\u2019s rich maritime history.\n\nAs twilight edges closer, the horizon glows ever so slightly with a promise of mystery; the forecast hints at patchy fog beginning after the clock strikes one, beckoning a more muted evening. The clouds will thicken, cloaking the streets in a veil as temperatures gently slide down to a cozy 67 degrees. It would be prudent to don a light sweater or jacket, encouraging warmth as the night embraces the city. Ideal pursuits for the evening might involve a leisurely stroll through the parks, perhaps accompanied by a novel or a friend, or enjoying the warmth of a caf\u00e9, where the clinking of cups against saucers pairs beautifully with the soft murmur of conversation as the day settles into night.",
