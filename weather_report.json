    "weather_report": "As the day edges gracefully toward night, Boston finds itself cloaked in a veil of anticipation. Snow graces the atmosphere, softly whispering promises of a winter wonderland to come. The air is brisk, stilled only by the gentle murmur of a southwest wind, hinting at the crispness to follow as the temperature dips tonight. It is a perfect night for layering\u2014a warm scarf, a sturdy coat, and perhaps some cozy mittens will serve well against the expected inches of pristine snowfall.\n\nAs we awaken to New Year\u2019s Day, the promise of a brightening sky beckons through lingering clouds, where remnants of snow may linger in scattered flurries, fading gently into the light of day. The chill in the air will remind the early risers of the season's bite, but as morning blossoms into afternoon, a semblance of warmth strives to emerge. With gusts rushing through the streets, this could be a day well-spent indoors, perhaps sipping on hot cocoa or exploring a cozy caf\u00e9 tucked away from the winter chill. Alternatively, if the allure of that soft blanket of snow beckons you outdoors, a brisk stroll through the city's parks, where snowflakes dance in the air and silence settles between the branches, may be just the tonic needed to welcome the year ahead.",
