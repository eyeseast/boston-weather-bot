    "weather_report": "In the quiet remnants of the night, the air in Boston is heavy with the promise of moisture. Drizzle gently kisses the earth, a soft veil of fog mingling with the chill that wraps around the city. The temperature drifts down to a modest low, as a brisk north wind stirs, carrying whispers of rain through the streets. Those early risers might catch the world still cloaked in darkness, with the city lights twinkling like a distant constellation beneath an overcast sky. The forecast suggests that this symphony of drizzle will continue, a persistent rhythm throughout the day, blending with patchy fog that obscures the horizon.\n\nAs morning rolls in, the day\u2019s light promises little respite from the damp chill. Expect a gray canvas overhead, with temperatures climbing only a few degrees. For those venturing out, a sturdy water-resistant jacket and perhaps a cozy scarf will be essential companions against the brisk breeze. A stroll through the neighborhoods might reveal a quiet beauty: the soft sound of rain dripping from tree leaves, mist curling around lampposts, and the world momentarily paused in a reflective state. Alternatively, a warm caf\u00e9 might beckon, inviting patrons to linger over steaming cups, wrapped in the comfort of a well-worn armchair, as rain dances against the windowpanes.",
