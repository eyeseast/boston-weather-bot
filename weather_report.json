    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens in Boston, a crisp and partially cloudy night unfolds. The biting chill settles around 25 degrees, driven by a brisk, westward wind that gusts fiercely, creating an atmosphere steeped in the biting clarity of winter. There\u2019s little in the way of fog to soften the edges of the night\u2014just the sharp silhouette of the skyline against a canvas of darkness punctuated by the glow of distant lights. It is a time when heavy coats feel like both a refuge and a necessity, and the sound of rustling scarves fills the air, echoing the sharpness of the coolness outside.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the promise of a mostly sunny day brings a degree of optimism. The anticipated high of 38 degrees will offer a chance for the chill of the night to relinquish its grip, if only slightly. The prevailing winds, though softened compared to tonight, will still carry a notable breeze, reminding wanderers to bundle up before venturing out. Such a day is perfect for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront; perhaps stopping for a warm beverage, the steam curling up into the crisp air. It might also invite a moment of quiet reflection in one of the city's parks, the stark trees standing sentinel against a brightening sky. As the day unfolds, layers will be key\u2014between a wool coat, a snug hat, and perhaps the comfort of warm gloves, one can embrace the beauty of a winter day, if only to savor the moments of warmth that come from within.",
