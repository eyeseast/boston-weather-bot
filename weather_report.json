    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds over Boston, a veil of clouds lingers, casting a muted light over the morning. Scattered showers and the rumble of distant thunder hint at the intermittent rain that will accompany the warmth reaching towards the high 90s in the later hours. The air is thick with humidity, making it feel even stickier. The breeze, although refreshing, carries with it a palpable tension, while gusts weave through the streets, rustling the leaves and stirring up the scent of impending rainfall. As the sun attempts to break through, its efforts feel both tentative and restless, creating an ambiance that is at once vibrant yet subdued.\n\nFor those venturing out, the heat and humidity suggest dressing in light, breathable fabrics; perhaps a linen shirt paired with comfortable shorts would suit the occasion. The chance of rain necessitates carrying a light jacket or a handy umbrella, ready for the spontaneous downpours expected in the early hours. Amid this unpredictable weather, a leisurely stroll along the waterfront might bring a bit of tranquility, allowing one to soak in the energy of the city. Alternatively, seeking shelter in one of Boston\u2019s many cozy cafes could provide both comfort and a perfect vantage point to watch the weather dance outside, an invitation to indulge in a well-deserved moment of pause.",
