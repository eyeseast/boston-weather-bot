    "weather_report": "In Boston today, a shroud of gray blankets the city, enveloping it in a moist embrace that whispers of drizzle and fog. The air carries a chill, lingering at a brisk 40 degrees, with each gust of the east wind rustling through the lingering remnants of winter. It\u2019s a day where visibility is muted; the horizon blurs, and the well-known skyline becomes an elusive silhouette against the drab canvas overhead. As the afternoon unfolds, expect those dreary conditions to persist, with occasional bouts of drizzle adding to the somber atmosphere\u2014a gentle reminder of nature's unpredictable temperament.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds will deepen, thickening with a chance of rain showers that may soon weave their way into the drizzly tapestry. The night will settle in around 38 degrees, a time for warmth and comfort. For those brave enough to venture out, consider bundling yourself in cozy layers\u2014perhaps a well-loved sweater beneath a waterproof jacket, rounded off with sturdy footwear for any unexpected puddles. While outdoor plans may be tinged with disappointment, the ambiance tonight lends itself well to intimate gatherings, perhaps a quiet evening curled up with a book or finally starting that series you\u2019ve been meaning to binge. Alternatively, an early evening caf\u00e9 visit could warm both body and spirit, as the scent of coffee mingles with the anticipation of spring\u2019s return, just beyond today\u2019s damp horizon.",
