    "weather_report": "Boston awakens under a heavy shroud of snow, as the clouds hang low, casting a muted gray over the city. The biting cold is palpable, with temperatures hovering around the frigid range, accompanied by winds that whistle through the streets, adding an extra chill that creeps into one's bones. As the day unfolds, expect the snow to continue, blanketing the landscape in a deceptive softness, while the gusts remind all of the winter's unsparing hand. \n\nThis is not a day for adventure but rather for coziness. The inclination to stay indoors is compelling, ideally wrapped in layers that shield you from the cold\u2014a thick, insulated coat, a knitted scarf, and sturdy boots designed to navigate the slushy remnants of winter\u2019s storm. Perhaps a comforting cup of tea or a warm bowl of soup awaits at home, inviting you to settle down with a good book or perhaps some gentle music. As night descends, the air will only grow colder, hinting at a spring tease that seems light-years away, making it the perfect evening for quiet reflection, or even the simple joy of watching the world transform into a winter wonderland.",
