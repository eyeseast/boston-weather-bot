    "weather_report": "As the shadows softly envelop Boston this evening, the air holds a slight chill, typical of a late December night. Patchy fog begins to cloak the landscape, whispering promises of rain as it mingles with the clouds hovering low. The temperature, gently settling around fifty degrees, invites a degree of warmth from layers, while the south wind stirs with a gentle breeze, adding a touch of briskness to the air. An 80% chance of rain suggests that these nocturnal drifts may merge into a light shower before morning, bearing the weight of cloudy stillness.\n\nTomorrow promises a continuation of this damp, murky ambiance, with rain showers lingering into the afternoon amidst the fog. As the day unfolds, temperatures will dip, enveloping us in a blanket of gray that, while not unbearable, might leave some yearning for the sun\u2019s more jovial embrace. One might find solace in a cozy caf\u00e9, indulgently sipping warm beverages while peering through rain-spattered windows, or perhaps choosing to explore the hushed charm of indoor venues, preserving courtesy to the weather outside. Dressing in layers, perhaps including a waterproof jacket and a soft scarf, would serve well to navigate the dampness that lies ahead.",
