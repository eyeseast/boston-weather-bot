    "weather_report": "As the clock approaches 7:30 PM in Boston, the evening falls under a blanket of rain and an encroaching fog, transforming the city into a realm of muted silhouettes and pitter-pattering sounds. The air is tinged with the coolness of impending snow, with temperatures lingering around a chilly 30 degrees. It is a night where the anticipated snowfall dances playfully with the rain, as gusty winds from the north rattle leaves and send a sharp shiver through the bones. The atmosphere is heavy, not just from the moisture, but from the weight of a 100% chance of precipitation, promising at least an inch of new snow to greet those brave enough to venture out.\n\nTomorrow brings a slight reprieve with snow likely to linger early in the day, accompanied by patches of fog that will fade into a mostly sunny afternoon. The anticipated chill remains, with the air feeling brisk and fresh, likely dropping to the low 20s. It would be wise to wrap oneself in layers; a cozy scarf and a sturdy coat will serve as allies against the crisp winter bite, while waterproof footwear will keep the frost at bay. It\u2019s a day to relish the quiet joys of winter: a leisurely stroll through frosted parks, or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where one can huddle over a steaming cup of coffee, watching the world transform outside.",
