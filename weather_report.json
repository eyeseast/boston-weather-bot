    "weather_report": "As night deepens over Boston, the promise of snow hangs in the cool, still air, a prelude to the delicate dance nature is about to perform. The clouds, heavy and overcast, shroud the city in a blanket of gray, signaling a snowfall beginning soon, likely just before night veers into dawn. Tonight, the capital will embrace the chill, with temperatures dipping to a biting 25 degrees. As the snow gently touches the ground, painting a fresh canvas, expect a modest accumulation that will cloak the streets in a quiet, white embrace, with fog whispering into being as the hours pass. \n\nMonday dawns with the remnants of snow lingering underfoot, as patchy fog may greet those who wander out before the sun climbs fully into the sky. The day promises a high near a temperate 44 degrees, wrapped in warm southwest breezes that invite freedom from heavy coats. The atmosphere, still layered with clouds, hints at a muted charm, softened contours, and a comforting melancholy. It will be best to dress in layers, perhaps donning a cozy sweater beneath a coat, ready for the transition from the morning chill to a more comfortable afternoon. A winter walk through the city might reveal the serene beauty of snow-kissed streets, while a visit to a local caf\u00e9 might provide the perfect refuge to savor a warm drink, enveloped in the fragrant warmth of coffee or cocoa as you watch the day unfold.",
