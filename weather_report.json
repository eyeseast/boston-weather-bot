    "weather_report": "The chill of night envelops Boston, where the air carries not just a hint of winter but a promise of snow as dawn approaches. The skies above are mostly cloudy, a blanket of gray obscure the stars, holding secrets that will soon reveal themselves in the form of flurries. As the world awakens, temperatures hover around a biting sixteen degrees, with an invigorating west wind whipping through the streets, making it feel even colder. This brisk gust serves as a reminder of the season, invigorating yet demanding a thoughtful preparation.\n\nAs the day unfolds, snow showers are on the horizon, likely to grace the city before the afternoon sun can take flight. With a high expected to reach twenty-nine, the oscillation of temperature and wind chill creates an atmosphere that is best approached with layers. A warm scarf, a hat snug against the ears, and a sturdy coat will serve well against the famed Boston breeze. Today's urban tapestry may not lend itself to leisurely strolls, but the glistening snow can transform an ordinary day; one might find solace in a cozy caf\u00e9, the aroma of fresh coffee mingling with the dusting of snow on the ground. Alternatively, a simple walk along the scenic Charles might reveal the understated beauty of a city turning itself white, inviting quiet reflection.",
