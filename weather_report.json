    "weather_report": "As the night lays a gentle veil over Boston, the air remains warm, hinting at a sultry summer day that waits to unfurl. The low temperature, resting around a balmy 71 degrees, caresses the skin as soft gusts of wind whisper through the trees. With no fog shrouding the city, the stars appear as distant diamonds against the vastness, twinkling softly amidst the electric glow of the skyline. Such a night invites quiet introspection or perhaps a leisurely midnight stroll along the waterfront, where the city\u2019s vibrancy hums even in these dark hours.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the promise of a sun-drenched Wednesday reveals itself. A radiant blue sky will bathe the Boston landscape in light, with temperatures soaring near 96 degrees under the sun's full embrace. The heat index will flirt with discomfort, urging residents to find cool shade and steady hydration. In the face of such warmth, light fabrics and breathable linens are the attire of the day \u2014 a sensible choice as one navigates through bustling streets or meanders along the scenic Charles River. Engaging in a slow afternoon at a favorite caf\u00e9 with an ice-cold drink or an afternoon book in the park seems the most prudent of choices. Before the oppressive heat sets in, a morning walk can also revitalize the spirit, allowing for a serene start to the day.",
