    "weather_report": "As the early hours of the morning embrace Boston, a thick blanket of clouds rests heavily overhead, creating an atmosphere that feels hushed and contemplative. The temperature dances around the 36-degree mark, lending a chill to the air that suggests more winter lies ahead. As dawn approaches, the forecast whispers promises of mostly sunny skies later in the day, yet, for now, a northwest wind gently unfurls, stirring a crispness that permeates the stillness of the night.\n\nBy the time the sun makes its appearance, expect a climb toward a high near 40, before the afternoon ushers in a notable drop back down to the colder realm of 32 degrees. Gusts may playfully tease the trees, reaching up to 30 mph, urging anyone who ventures outdoors to wrap themselves warmly against the wind's bite. This is no day for light jackets; consider layering thick sweaters beneath a sturdy coat, accompanied by a stylish scarf to fend off the cold. The gusty conditions allow for a brisk stroll through the quiet streets, perhaps indulging in coffee from a beloved caf\u00e9, allowing the warmth to seep into fingertips long chilled by winter's grasp. With the sun trying to break through the ever-persistent clouds, the day beckons exploration, especially for those who appreciate the serene beauty of a city awakening amidst shifting weather.",
