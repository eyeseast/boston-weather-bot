    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Boston, a cloak of clouds blankets the city, wrapping it in muted tones that reflect the impending moisture of the night. The air carries a slight chill, a reminder that spring still teeters on the edge of whimsy. A chance of rain greets the night, a gentle tap on the windowpane from a world that waits with bated breath for the droplets to fall. The wind whispers softly, nudging the temperature down to a cool embrace, perfect for a light jacket\u2014or perhaps a comforting scarf\u2014to ward off the lingering dampness and chill.\n\nAs dawn approaches tomorrow, one might rise to find the fog curling up from the ground, veiling the city in a gentle haze. The likelihood of rain increases as the hours pass, so expect a day rich with soft showers that pose a poetic contrast to the vibrant energy of the city. Dress warmly and resiliently for the day ahead, as you navigate through the thick fog and wet roads, opting for layers that will keep you comfortable through various moods of the weather. Indoor pursuits may beckon, be they quiet afternoons in a cozy caf\u00e9 with a novel, or perhaps a leisurely stroll through the local museums where the air is vibrant with the whispers of creativity, sheltered from the constant dance of the rain\u2014offering a perfect reprieve against the tumult outside.",
