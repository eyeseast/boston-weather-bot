    "weather_report": "As the night drapes quietly over Boston, a veil of clouds hangs low, creating a soft hush that blankets the city. The temperature lingers in the cool embrace of the mid-forties, accompanied by a gentle breeze whispering at seven miles per hour. Despite the obscured skies, the twinkling lights beneath offer a comforting glow, as if the city is nestled in a warm embrace, waiting for the dawn.\n\nWhen morning unfurls, a blend of sun and clouds will awaken the day, promising a high around sixty-four degrees. The northwest wind will carry a refreshing note, perfect for those who venture outdoors. It is a delightful invitation to don a light jacket over a cozy sweater, perhaps complemented by a comfortable pair of jeans or layered clothing that navigates the shift of warmth as the sun peeks through. With such palpable potential for pleasant moments, one might meander along the Charles River, where the subtle rustle of leaves and the soft lap of water can mend weary souls. Alternatively, a leisurely stroll through a local market to savor the scents of fresh blooms or artisanal goods can create a charming start to the day. The atmosphere suits the gentle rhythm of life, nurturing quiet moments of appreciation amidst the vibrant pulse of the city.",
