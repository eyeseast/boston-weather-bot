    "weather_report": "As the night drapes its heavy cloak over Boston, a persistent rain falls gently, accompanied by the whispers of patchy fog that seem to wrap around the city. The air feels cooler, yet the promise of warmth lingers as temperatures subtly rise towards the dawn. The sound of raindrops harmonizes with the winds that gust intermittently, creating a symphony of winter\u2019s embrace\u2014a foreboding yet serene entrance to the day ahead. \n\nTomorrow, Boston will awaken under cloudy skies, with early hours likely draped in mist and rain. There\u2019s a chance for the sun to peek through the clouds in the afternoon, inviting a brief reprieve from the dreariness, though the air will turn cooler as the day unfurls. Beneath these ever-changing skies, the best attire would be layers: a sturdy raincoat and a comfortable sweater beneath, perhaps complemented by waterproof shoes to navigate puddled streets. As the rain gently weaves through city life, consider cozy domestic pursuits like reading in a favorite armchair or savoring a hot drink at a local caf\u00e9\u2014perfect for moments that blur time while sheltering from the chill outside.",
