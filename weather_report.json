The clouds loom heavily, their dark forms dripping with moisture, while a brisk west wind whips through the streets, sending a shiver through those bold enough to venture outside. The temperature hovers near a chill that urges the wise to bundle in layers, perhaps donning a sturdy coat paired with a wool scarf; warm gloves will also provide a welcome shield against the biting breeze. The rain, expected to grace the city until around ten, will likely leave the ground sparkling with a layer of fresh droplets, offering a moment of serene beauty amid the storm.\n\nLooking ahead to Washington's Birthday, a transformation awaits\u2014a scattered sky giving way to glimpses of sunlight across the city. As the sun fights to shine through, the temperature will crawl to a more agreeable level, urging residents to cast off their winter blues in favor of outdoor pursuits. A brisk walk through the quiet, snow-dusted streets or a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9 with a steaming cup may be just the balm the soul needs, gently nudging you to admire the beauty of a winter nearly at its end. Remembering to dress warmly will be paramount, but today, a sense of adventure beckons amid the shifting weather, inviting all to embrace the unique rhythm of this chilly season.",
