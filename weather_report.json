    "weather_report": "As dawn gently breaks over Boston, the air hangs heavy with the promise of rain, mixed with a whisper of fog that lends a muted articulation to the waking world. The coolness nips at your cheeks, hovering around a moderate 40 degrees, inviting you to wrap yourself in layers. A solitary west wind barely rustles the branches, making the morning feel still and contemplative. As the day unfolds, the clouds are expected to conquer the skyline, with intermittent showers anticipated before the afternoon sun peeks through, albeit faintly.\n\nThe overarching grayness gives the city a tranquil, if somber, hue, perfect for those seeking solace in a quiet caf\u00e9 with a good book or for a leisurely stroll under an umbrella, listening to the distant sound of soft rain pattering against cobblestone. Dress wisely in a lightweight, water-resistant jacket and comfortable shoes \u2014 perfect for both the unpredictable dampness and an afternoon exploration of Boston's rich history. Today feels like an invitation to slow down, maybe indulge in a timely visit to a local museum or enjoy a warm beverage while people-watching from a cozy window seat. As the forecast hints at fleeting moments of brightness later, let the day unfold gently as the city breathes in that familiar blend of rain and possibility.",
