    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Boston, a heavy curtain of cloud hangs low, pierced occasionally by the flicker of streetlights struggling against the encroaching darkness. A symphony of showers and thunderstorms has likely danced across the city, leaving in its wake patches of fog that now weave through the streets like faint whispers. With temperatures settling around a crisp 58 degrees, the air feels damp and charged, hinting at the possibility of more rain as the night deepens. A gentle swell of southwest winds keeps the atmosphere fresh, yet a slight chill clings to the skin, reminding those venturing outdoors to reach for a light jacket or a cozy sweater.\n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, expect a moody, overcast day, with fleeting moments of patchy fog casting a tranquil spell over the city. The temperature will rise gently to around 72, yet will taper off to a cooler 65 by afternoon, suggesting an unpredictable but pleasant day ahead. It might be wise to wear layers, embracing both comfort and readiness for those elusive sunbeams or unexpected drizzle. A stroll along the Charles or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 seems fitting, allowing the day to unfold at a leisurely pace while sheltering in the warmth of affection found in good company.",
