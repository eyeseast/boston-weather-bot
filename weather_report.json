    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfurls its muted hues in Boston, a blanket of cloud gently envelops the skyline, offering a sense of tranquility amid the brisk spring air. With the day hovering around a cool fifty-six degrees and a northwest wind whispering through the streets at a steady eighteen miles per hour, the atmosphere breathes a refreshing chill. A mere hint of rain lingers in the forecast, although its appearance seems hesitant, likely to part ways before making any real impact. The chance for precipitation is low, resting easily at twenty percent, yet the clouds may drape the city with an enigmatic charm, lending itself to contemplative walks or quiet moments in sheltered spots.\n\nAs dusk approaches, expect the temperature to dip, settling to a comfortable forty-eight degrees. The winds will remain present, possibly prompting one to reach for a light jacket or scarf\u2014a wise choice for those who find solace in the calming embrace of the outdoors during these fleeting daylight hours. With the late afternoon sun struggling to break through the cloud cover, it may be an opportune time for leisurely pursuits that require neither the bustle of crowded places nor the blazing heat of unfiltered sunlight. Perhaps a quiet stroll along the Charles River will yield thoughts unfettered, or a seat at a local caf\u00e9 can nurture one\u2019s spirit with warm coffee as the world outside drifts softly into the evening.",
