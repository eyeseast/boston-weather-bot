    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, the air carries a comfortable warmth, tempered by a gentle breeze. The sky, a mosaic of bright blues intertwined with soft, pillowy clouds, hints at the possibility of fleeting showers later in the day. With a high approaching 82 degrees, this is the kind of day that invites both the sun\u2019s caress and the faint promise of summer storms. The humidity lingers subtly, but for now, a pleasant clarity dominates the atmosphere, making it an ideal time for leisurely strolls in the park or an afternoon spent sipping iced tea on the balcony.\n\nAs twilight approaches, temperatures will dip to a soft 61 degrees, bringing a slight chill that may coax women into cardigans and men into light jackets. There\u2019s a gentle touch of unpredictability in the evening air, as the chance for rain lingers in the backdrop, whispering of impending showers. Yet, the sky promises a beautiful transition, where the golden hues of the setting sun will dance with the clouds. Whether one chooses to embrace this unpredictability with a chance of an outdoor gathering or a quiet night spent indoors, the essence of the day is simple: a harmonious blend of warmth and the cooling anticipation of evening breezes.",
