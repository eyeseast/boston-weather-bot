    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Boston, a gentle murmur of rain begins to whisper against the rooftops, heralding a change in the air. With the temperature dipping around 43 degrees, a chill settles in, and the northeast wind carries a crispness that wraps the city in a cool embrace. There\u2019s a tentative promise of dawn\u2014cloudy skies heavy with moisture are a harbinger of the rain likely to drench the morning. The fog, creeping quietly from the harbor, blurs the edges of familiar sights and draws a veil over the details, adding a touch of mystery to the night.\n\nAs you wake to this cool, wet Thursday, prepare for a day best spent indoors or dressed for comfort against the chill. With rain likely cascading from the grey clouds overhead and the chance of visibility reduced by patchy fog, a good, sturdy coat and waterproof footwear will serve you well. Nestle into a favorite caf\u00e9, perhaps, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the sound of soft music\u2014the perfect backdrop for catching up on reading or quietly reflecting. Alternatively, consider visiting a local museum, where the warmth and rich history can be an inviting escape from the dampness outside. On a day like this, Boston transforms into a haven of cozy activities, where the mundane is tinged with the beauty of quiet moments.",
