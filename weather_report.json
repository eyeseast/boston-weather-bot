    "weather_report": "As the darkness drapes itself over Boston, a tranquil evening unfolds with a cool breeze rustling in from the northwest. The air carries a hint of anticipation for what tomorrow will bring, as the low temperature hovers comfortably around sixty, inviting blankets and a soft glow from bedside lamps. The stars peek intermittently through scattered clouds, lending the night an ethereal quality that teeters between the sleepy and the hopeful.\n\nAwakening to Friday, Boston promises a canvas of mostly sunny skies. The day will unfold with a gentle caress of warmth, reaching a pleasant seventy-eight degrees. It will be a day to savor, with the willowy touch of a north wind barely stirring, as if nature itself were indulging in a moment of calm. A light sweater or long sleeves in the morning would suffice, with lighter fabrics ready to embrace the sun\u2019s afternoon touch. As the world stirs to life, consider a stroll through the Public Garden, where the morning light plays among the leaves, or perhaps a quiet exploration of the quaint streets of Beacon Hill, where history whispers from the bricks. The air, crisp yet inviting, is perfect for an early summer trek or sipping coffee outdoors, full of intention.",
