    "weather_report": "In Boston, the morning unfolds under a thick blanket of cloud, the dim light hinting at the impending snowfall that lingers in the air. The forecast carries a promise of snow before noon, casting a chilly spell over the city. As the clock progresses, the temperature hovers around a biting 35 degrees, and a brisk wind from the west carries the chill further into one's bones. An air of uncertainty hangs about, with a 50% chance of precipitation suggesting that those venturing out should brace themselves for the possibility of a light dusting, adding a fragile layer to the already wintry scene. \n\nAs twilight approaches, the skies are expected to clear, ushering in a calm night where the temperature dives to a frosty 18 degrees. With a north wind whispering softly, it beckons warm layers\u2014think cozy sweaters, perhaps a robust winter coat, and be sure to wrap yourself in a scarf to fend off the evening's chill. Given the overcast start to the day, your best plans may necessitate indoor comforts: perhaps a leisurely afternoon spent browsing the shelves of a favorite bookstore, or sipping hot cocoa while lost in conversation with a friend by the fire. Winter in Boston invites a reflective pace, urging you to seek warmth and solace away from the frigid breath of the day.",
