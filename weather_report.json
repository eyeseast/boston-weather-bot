    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, the air carries a whisper of moisture, heralding the arrival of lingering showers and the occasional rumble of thunder that reverberates softly in the distance. The clouds, heavy and gray, drape the city, painting a scene of muted colors against the glow of streetlights still flickering in the early morning. With temperatures hovering around a cool 51 degrees, it\u2019s a reminder that spring has not fully shaken off winter's chill. Those stepping out will find themselves accompanied by a gentle south wind that brushes against the skin, a hint of warmth beneath the overcast sky.\n\nAs the day unfolds, scattered showers and patchy fog are forecasted to linger through the morning, hovering lightly over the city like a soft shawl, before the sun attempts to break free later on. By midday, however, it is expected to rise to a warmer embrace, around 80 degrees, as if the universe conspires to restore a sense of normalcy after the night\u2019s tempest. It would be wise to dress in layers today; a light jacket will serve well against the dampness of the morning as one ventures into the unfolding day, while comfortable attire for the early warmth will make for an ease of movement in the hours to come. Perhaps indulge in the simple joy of a quiet stroll through the Public Garden, or visit one of the old coffee shops where the rich aroma of brewing coffee mingles with the sounds of soft conversation. Such moments turn into tender memories against the backdrop of an evolving sky\u2014a reminder to savor each fleeting second as spring dances toward summer.",
