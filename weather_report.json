    "weather_report": "In Boston, as evening approaches, the city is softly draped in a mantle of muted light, with layers of clouds casting gentle shadows upon the neighborhoods below. This afternoon\u2019s warmth barely reaches 49 degrees, attended by a crisp northwest breeze that brings a reminder of the lingering chill of early spring. While the sun teases from behind a gauzy veil of gray, the forecast hints at a possibility of rain showers after 5 PM, creating a subtle tension in the air; the chance is modest, yet one can sense the dance of weather in the backdrop of urban life.\n\nAs nightfall sweeps in, the temperature will descend to around 33 degrees, prompting thoughtful choices in attire. A warm jacket, perhaps layered over a light sweater, would suffice to combat the encroaching coolness, while a sturdy umbrella might find a place in your hand just in case the sky weeps. The ambience, tinged with both the promise of gentle rain and the clarity of crisp air, invites a leisurely evening stroll through the quiet streets or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 where steaming mugs of tea or coffee await, perfect companions for contemplation on this softly dramatic day.",
