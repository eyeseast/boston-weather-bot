    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Boston, the air carries a gentle warmth, despite the lingering coolness of the evening. The night sky, mostly clear with stars quietly winking goodbye, will soon give way to a sunlit canvas. By day\u2019s peak, you can expect a pleasant embrace of warmth as the thermometer nudges toward the mid-eighties. The soft caress of the southwest breeze will also accompany this warmth, allowing for a comfort that whispers of lazy summer days ahead.\n\nIn this inviting weather, a humble suggestion would lean toward light fabrics\u2014perhaps a simple cotton shirt and breathable shorts or slacks. A light cardigan could serve well for those moments when the sun sinks low or behind clouds momentarily. As for the day\u2019s pursuits, consider wandering through the lush expanses of Franklin Park, or perhaps indulging in a leisurely coffee at an inviting caf\u00e9 where the hum of conversation and the aroma of fresh brew blend seamlessly into the background. It is a day to savor the mundane joys, wrapped in nature\u2019s warmth and the gentle conversations of a bustling city awakening to the promise of summer.",
