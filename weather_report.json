    "weather_report": "As night blankets Boston in a thin veil of clouds, the air carries the crisp bite of winter with a low settling around fourteen degrees. A gentle northwest wind stirs softly through the streets, whispering promises of a chill that beckons for warmth. The dim glow of city lights flickers like distant stars, their reflections glimmering hazily in the muted darkness. Tonight, the atmosphere feels contemplative, almost serene, though the promise of snow looms on the horizon, expected to sprinkle the town with delicate flurries as Monday unfolds. \n\nIn anticipation of the day ahead, one might dress with care; a thick woolen layer topped with a stylish yet practical coat will suffice. Scarves wrapped snugly around the neck shall serve not only as protection against the cold but also as a subtle nod to the season's charm. The chance of snow around mid-afternoon opens up an inviting opportunity for fleeting winter pleasures\u2014perhaps a gentle stroll among the majestic trees in the Public Garden, or a quiet afternoon spent sipping cocoa in a quaint caf\u00e9, savoring the rich aroma that fills the air. Activities that resonate with the pulse of the day ahead may not be extravagant, but they carry with them a satisfying warmth\u2014the kind that lingers long after the day ends.",
