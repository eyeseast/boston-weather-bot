    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Boston, the landscape is cloaked in a deep stillness, punctuated only by the soft glimmer of city lights. The air is crisp, carrying the distinct bite of late winter, as temperatures dip toward the low 30s. Tonight presents itself as partly cloudy, allowing brief glimpses of the celestial tapestry above, with a gentle west wind whispering through the streets. Though the shadows linger, there's a sense of calm that invites moments of introspection or quiet conversation over a warm cup of tea.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Wednesday, the sun will stretch its golden limbs across the sky, promising a brighter visage with temperatures inching toward the mid-40s. The day is set to be a pleasant interlude before spring asserts itself, as gentle breezes dance through the trees and around the corners of the city, encouraging the hatless and coatless among us to venture out. It is a day suited for a leisurely stroll along the public garden paths or perhaps a thoughtful visit to a local bookstore, where one might browse for stories to accompany the gentle warmth of the sun. Layers will serve you well, but a light jacket should suffice to stave off any lingering chill as you navigate this inviting tableau.",
