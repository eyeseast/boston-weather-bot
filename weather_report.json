    "weather_report": "In Boston today, a gentle sun bathes the landscape, lending warmth to the air as it reaches near 80 degrees. The morning has unfurled into a tapestry of mostly sunny skies, effortlessly punctuated by soft clouds drifting lazily overhead. A pleasant southwestern breeze nudges through the streets, whispering the promise of autumn adventures. As the day progresses, one can expect the sky to soften to a muted gray, cloaking the city in a shroud of clouds by nightfall, with temperatures falling to a comfortable 63 degrees.\n\nSuch delightful weather invites you to pull on your favorite lightweight sweater and perhaps a pair of breathable chinos. Why not take a meandering walk along the Charles River, where the reflections shimmer against the water\u2019s surface, or perhaps find a nearby caf\u00e9 to savor a cup of rich coffee? As the sun descends into the horizon, cozy up with a book or engage in intimate conversation with friends on a patio, absorbing the ephemeral beauty of the day. The outdoor sculpture parks and historic sidewalks of your city await, ready for exploration under a sky that promises an unusually pleasant Halloween eve.",
