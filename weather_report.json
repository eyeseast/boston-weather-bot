    "weather_report": "As the night casts its gentle shadow over Boston, a veil of patchy fog embraces the city, carrying with it the whispers of the warm air. The low temperature, resting at a comfortable 68 degrees, sits neatly beneath the linen-draped stars. With a light breeze from the west nudging the trees, the world outside feels tranquil yet alive, beckoning a moment of quiet reflection or a leisurely stroll along the illuminated pathways.\n\nCome morning, the sun will awaken, shedding the foggy tendrils and filling the sky with promises of a mostly sunny day ahead. As temperatures climb toward a pleasant 91 degrees, the air will hum with activity. Dressing in light, breathable fabrics will be essential; perhaps consider a soft cotton shirt paired with comfortable shorts, complemented by a wide-brimmed hat to shield the eyes from the sun's warm embrace. Given the inviting weather, a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a morning coffee might be in order, followed by a stroll through one of Boston's charming parks. Alternatively, an afternoon spent exploring the vibrant streets lined with local art and culture could yield delightful surprises, marking the day with engaging experiences.",
