    "weather_report": "Boston finds itself wrapped in a soft shroud of clouds today, the sky a muted canvas of gray that hints at a gentle nudge of moisture in the air. As we drift through the afternoon, temperatures hover near a cool 54 degrees, with a steady northeast breeze that whispers against the skin. The sea of clouds neither offers the luxurious drama of sunlight nor the sharp clarity of a crisp blue sky; today, it simply envelops the city, enticing thoughts of warm broths and cozy corners. \n\nAs dusk approaches, there lingers a gentle promise of rain\u2014perhaps just a sprinkle, a shy invitation from the heavens set to arrive after the early morning light retreats. With the temperature dropping to around 47 degrees tonight, it\u2019s wise to wrap oneself warmly; a light jacket layered over a sweater would suffice, especially if you plan to stroll through the damp streets, where the reflections of city lights glimmer like diamonds in puddles. The vibey coffee shop beckons, where the scent of roasted beans can warm your spirits, or an art exhibit might entice the curious soul eager to embrace the creativity that thrives within the heart of this historical city.",
