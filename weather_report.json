    "weather_report": "Today, Boston bathes in the gentle embrace of summer, as the sun shines brilliantly overhead, rendering the skyline an inviting sight against a backdrop of clear azure. The air carries the tantalizing warmth of a near-perfect day, nudging the mercury close to the low eighties. With a light northwest breeze whispering through the streets, today is one for leisurely strolls and spontaneous outings \u2014 perhaps a visit to the park or a quiet lunch in a caf\u00e9 with outdoor seating, where one might savor a moment of existence, cradled by the soft sounds of the city, punctuated only by the laughter of friends and the chirping of birds. \n\nAs the sun begins its descent, the evening will tease a cooler embrace, dropping to a tranquil sixty-one, inviting the cozy comfort of a light sweater or jacket as night unfolds. There\u2019s something inherently delightful in the promise of a clear evening, perfect for casual conversations under the stars or a gentle wander past the riverbanks. Dressing in breathable fabrics during the day will complement the warmth, while layering up for the cool night will ensure comfort throughout your July Fourth festivities. With the day stretching ahead, Boston awaits your adventures with open arms, each moment an opportunity to embrace the beauty of summer in the city.",
