    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of the night, Boston rests under a blanket of partial clouds, the air sharp but crisp, whispering hints of the chill that heralds the dawn. With temperatures dipping close to the low teens, a gentle westward breeze brings a subtle swish against the stillness, a beckoning call for layered clothing. As morning grows nearer, the city will awaken to an invitation of partly sunny spells, with just enough warmth in the sunlight to hint at the promise of a brighter day, even as wisps of clouds linger above.\n\nAs the day unfolds, there\u2019s a mere chance of snowflakes, a soft anticipation in the air after 5 PM. Perhaps a touch of winter's magic will dust the city, though the accumulation is expected to remain light, merely a caress upon the landscape rather than a shroud. In this weather, a well-coordinated ensemble of warm layers, cozy scarves, and sturdy boots will ensure comfort while venturing outdoors. The late afternoon light is perfect for a brisk stroll along the Charles River, where the reflections dance on the water\u2019s surface. Alternatively, a visit to one of the many inviting caf\u00e9s might be the perfect treat\u2014sipping a warm brew while watching the world meander by through frosted windows. These activities complement both the chill of the day and the serene beauty of a city at rest, promising a pleasant embrace of the seasonal splendor that Boston shares with its inhabitants.",
