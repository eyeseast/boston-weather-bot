    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, the air carries a palpable tension, hinting at the imminent arrival of scattered showers and thunderstorms. The clouds begin to weave a tapestry of gray overhead, softening the light that spills across the city. Temperatures, once climbing toward a mild 66, will soon yield to the cooler embrace of the low 60s, a gentle reminder that spring\u2019s warming touch can still waver. A breeze from the southwest stirs, a companion that invites one to step outside, though not without a light jacket to fend off the moisture that lingers in the air.\n\nAs night descends, the clouds will part slightly, revealing glimpses of stars amidst the drifting remnants of afternoon storms. With temperatures dipping to 40, the crispness will call for warmth, perhaps a knitted scarf or a well-loved coat. Such a setting is perfect for an evening stroll through the brick-lined streets of Beacon Hill, or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the day\u2019s fading warmth. As the thunder rumbles in the distance, it serves as a gentle reminder to embrace the beauty of this transitional season, one raindrop at a time.",
