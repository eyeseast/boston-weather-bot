    "weather_report": "Tonight in Boston, the city dons a cloak of clouds, wrapping its neighborhoods in a soft, gray blanket. The temperature dips to a brisk 29 degrees, accompanied by a gentle south wind whispering through the streets. As the evening unfolds, the scintillating urban glow flickers against the darkening sky, creating a quiet yet vibrant tapestry of lights. The atmosphere feels crisp, with a hint of frost in the air that speaks to the winter season\u2019s embrace.\n\nAs we look ahead to tomorrow, the morning promises a continuation of the muted clouds, with only the faintest hints of brightness struggling to break through. Daytime temperatures will inch upwards, nearing 42 degrees under soft southeast breezes that tease the chill away. While it may not be the most inviting day to explore the great outdoors, a light jacket is advisable to ward off the lingering cold. Perhaps curl up with a warm beverage at a favorite caf\u00e9, losing yourself in the pages of a good book or the musings of a friend. Alternatively, an afternoon walk through one of Boston\u2019s quieter parks could reveal the serene beauty of the season, as nature gradually prepares for the onset of deeper winter.",
