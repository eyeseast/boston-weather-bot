    "weather_report": "As the afternoon drapes itself over Boston, the city embraces a gentle warmth, the kind that beckons you outdoors without hesitation. Showers have danced lightly in the sky before retreating, leaving behind a canvass streaked with bright sun and a high that flirts with 77 degrees. The air is punctuated by a light breeze from the east, whispering the soft messages of early autumn. Clarity reigns, as the horizon merges seamlessly into the azure expanse above; no fog disrupts the view, only the promise of a pristine evening.\n\nTonight, the city will settle under a dome of clarity, with temperatures dipping to a comfortable 58 degrees, encouraging you to trade your afternoon attire for something a touch cozier. A light sweater or a jacket would be a wise companion as you wander through the evening streets, perhaps stopping at a quaint caf\u00e9 or enjoying a leisurely stroll by the water. As day fades, Boston invites you to embrace its serene autumn twilight, weaving through golden leaves and the inviting hum of evening conversations, a perfect way to conclude your day.",
