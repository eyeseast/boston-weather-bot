    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Boston, the air carries a damp chill, punctuated by the scent of impending rain. The current low hangs around 52, cloaking the city in a shroud of fog that muffles sound and blurs the crisp edges of the skyline. A gentle southeast breeze stirs modestly, hinting at the shift in weather that is to come. The forecast whispers of rain and patches of fog that may linger like elusive memories through the night, suggesting a retreat from the bustling day into the warmth of cozy indoors. \n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, this rainy companionship will continue, enveloping the city in a gray embrace, with highs reaching near 60. Dressing in layers, one might opt for a light waterproof jacket to ward off the cool moisture that promises to coax the leaves from their slumber, while sturdy shoes will keep your footing secure on wet pavements. The probability of rain dances around 70%, a good reminder to take an umbrella along as you wander through the misty streets or ponder a cup of warm coffee at a corner caf\u00e9. This evening is best spent seeking solace indoors, perhaps curling up with a good book or enjoying a quiet dinner, allowing the symphony of rain against the window to weave a calming backdrop to your thoughts.",
