    "weather_report": "In Boston this afternoon, a hushed cloud cover blankets the city, wrapping its iconic skyline in a gentle embrace of gray. The air is brisk, as a northwest wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it a refreshing crispness that hints at the transition of seasons. As temperatures linger around a comfortable 62 degrees, the atmosphere feels both invigorating and serene; ideal for an afternoon stroll through the emerald parks or a leisurely diversion along the harbor. \n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds will part to reveal a mostly clear night sky, inviting the stars to peek through and whisper their ancient secrets. With temperatures settling comfortably in the low 48s, a light jacket or sweater will suffice as the Western breeze cools the air. This is a time for simple pleasures\u2014perhaps a quiet dinner over table games with friends or a reflective walk under the fading light. The day's subdued beauty pairs well with the warmth of companionship, offering moments to savor the gentle pulse of life surrounding you.",
