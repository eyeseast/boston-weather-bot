    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds in Boston, a brisk chill envelops the city, the air crisp and biting under a canopy of partly cloudy skies. The temperature has dropped to a low of around 12, with the wind wrapping itself around you like a sharp embrace at twenty miles per hour, creating wind chill values that feel even colder. In this twilight haze, the streetlights flicker to life, illuminating a city nestled under nightfall's blanket. The skies, though devoid of fog, maintain a gauzy quality, revealing only hints of distant stars battling the glow of the urban landscape.\n\nTomorrow, Boston anticipates a clear and bright sunrise, promising a day bathed in sunlight with temperatures climbing near 21. A similar wind will carry throughout the day, a companion that lingers just enough to remind you of the winter chill. It may not be the best time for a leisurely walk along the Charles, but a brisk jaunt through downtown might be invigorating, perhaps with a stop at a cozy caf\u00e9 to warm your hands around a steaming mug. To embrace the elements, dressing in layers is advisable\u2014a snug scarf, a well-insulated coat, and sturdy boots to weather the wind. As the mantle of night remains, consider the simple pleasure of a warming meal at home, where you can let the chill drift away with the evening's shadow.",
