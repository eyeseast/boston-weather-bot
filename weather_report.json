    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Boston, the evening air carries a crispness that heralds the chill of winter. The gloom of night wraps the city in a cozy darkness, punctuated by the distant glow of lights, flickering like stars fallen to earth. The temperature lingers around the low 30s, promising a cool night with a persistent southwest wind that whispers in at 16 to 22 mph, a lively companion to anyone brave enough to venture outside.\n\nIn the hours to come, Tuesday will bring scattered snow showers, dancing delicately in the morning light before giving way to a clearer afternoon, where a solitary sun will emerge to battle the cold. A high near the upper 30s will eventually give way to a drop in temperature, leaving behind a biting chill as the day progresses. Those wishing to venture out should dress warmly; think layers to keep the bite of the wind at bay\u2014perhaps a woolen scarf, a sturdy coat, and a cap to shield against the brisk embrace of winter. With gusts reaching up to 44 mph, it's a day to hold onto your hat while embracing a brisk walk or visiting a quiet caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink while the world outside transforms into a scenic winter postcard.",
