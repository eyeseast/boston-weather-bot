    "weather_report": "As the serene night drapes over Boston, the city twinkles beneath a clear sky, its lights shimmering like scattered jewels against the deepened shades of evening. The air is crisp and invigorating, carrying a quiet chill that hints at the transition toward winter. Tonight's low temperature, resting comfortably around 28 degrees, beckons for a warm coat and perhaps a cozy hat as you step outside. This calm before the daybreak tomorrow promises sunny skies, where the sun will ascend with a brilliant clarity, casting a refreshing warmth on the cobbled streets.\n\nAs Thursday unfolds, the sun will rise to greet you, setting a cheerful tone with highs near 46, though a gentle north wind might cause the temperatures to cool as the afternoon approaches. This creature of light encourages a leisurely stroll along the Charles River or a quiet moment spent in one of Boston\u2019s lush parks, embracing the tranquility of nature before the bustling weekends return. Layer yourself comfortably; a light sweater beneath your coat should suffice, allowing for the brisk air to invigorate your spirit while keeping you cozy. With this day offering a canvas of serene beauty, it's the perfect opportunity to sip a warm drink at an outdoor caf\u00e9, watch the world drift by, or perhaps visit a local museum, soaking in the art and culture that define the heart of this historic city.",
