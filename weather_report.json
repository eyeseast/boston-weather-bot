    "weather_report": "A gentle warmth blankets Boston this morning, as the day promises a taste of summer with temperatures lingering near 90. The air is thick with anticipation, the heat index nudging itself to nearly 97, gentle breezes whispering through the streets at 8 to 13 mph from the southwest. There\u2019s a playful dance of sun and cloud overhead, a partly sunny sky beckoning residents outdoors, though the faint chance of scattered rain showers later in the evening suggests that a touch of unpredictability lingers in the air.\n\nAs evening approaches, the atmosphere shifts, welcoming clouds that carry the possibility of rain and thunderstorms. The warmth of the day will give way to a balmy night, with conditions growing increasingly humid. In preparation for this sultry evening, a lightweight layer might be a wise choice, perhaps a breathable shirt accompanied by comfortable shorts or light trousers, perfect for transitioning from sunlight to the gentle grip of twilight fog. As you ponder how to spend your day, consider a leisurely stroll along the esplanade or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 where you can sip a cool drink. As the sun sets, find solace in the vibrant spirit of the city, perhaps indulging in an intimate dinner with family or friends, where laughter and the clinking of glasses may fill the air before the rain arrives.",
