    "weather_report": "In the quiet embrace of the early morning, Boston finds itself under a blanket of clarity, the air fresh and cool, whispering of brisk autumnal charms. Tonight's sky, now mostly clear, has delivered a gentle chill, settling low around the mid-forties. A subtle west wind stirs, making the air feel just alive enough to warrant a light jacket. As dawn breaks, Tuesday promises to unfurl with a generous sun painting the horizon, though temperatures will slowly descend, hinting at the day's cooler tendencies as afternoon approaches. The northwest winds will sweep through, brisk and boisterous, lending a lively character to the otherwise serene day.\n\nThis combination of sun and wind invites you to embrace the outdoors, perhaps for a peaceful stroll along the Charles or a visit to one of Boston's many quaint caf\u00e9s, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee melds with the crisp morning air. Dressing in layers will serve you well; think of a cozy sweater beneath a light coat to ward off any lingering chill, complemented by sturdy footwear for your explorations. As the day unfolds, allow the sunshine to brighten your spirits, reveling in the simple beauty of a New England autumn day.",
