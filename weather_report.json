    "weather_report": "This morning, Boston awakens under a mostly sunny sky, the sunlight casting a gentle glow over the city. Though the high temperature lingers around a brisk 39 degrees, the day\u2019s warmth is inviting, cradled by a light west wind that rustles a few remaining leaves. As noon approaches, the clarity of the air reveals the outline of the city\u2019s skyline we\u2019ve come to love, embodying both the vibrant pulse and serene stillness that characterize this season.\n\nYet as twilight draws near, the clouds will gather, swirling softly across the horizon with a promise of the cooler night that will settle upon us, lowering temperatures to around 27 degrees. For the afternoon stroll or an outing, dressing in layers is recommended; warm sweaters and a sturdy jacket will shield you from the encroaching chill, while a light scarf might be a thoughtful addition. Consider a gentle walk along the Charles River, embracing the transitional beauty of the late fall, where the reflection of the sky dances upon the water, inspiring quiet reflection. Or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh coffee mingles with the soft hum of conversation, can offer a pleasant respite as the day matures into evening.",
