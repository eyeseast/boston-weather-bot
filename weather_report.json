Dressing in layers will ensure comfort\u2014an inviting sweater or a light jacket, paired with a warm scarf to shield against the evening chill. With the sun arching high and the light playing among the skyscrapers, there\u2019s no better time to savor a hot cup of coffee outside, embracing the beauty of a New England day.",
