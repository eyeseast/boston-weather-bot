    "weather_report": "In the pre-dawn hours of Boston, a thick cloak of clouds envelops the city, the remnants of night still lingering as a gentle shroud. The atmosphere feels charged with the potential of the day ahead, bearing hints of moisture and warmth. With the temperature holding steady around a mild 61 degrees, a soft south wind stirs, whispering promises of both rain and renewal. As the morning unfolds, a deepening grayness will soon give way to the sound of raindrops tapping on windows, heralding a day marked by the mix of clouds and fleeting thunderstorms.\n\nAs you consider venturing out, it's wise to prepare for the impending showers. Light layers would serve you best; a comfortable shirt accompanied by a waterproof jacket will safeguard against the elements without sacrificing breathability. The morning\u2019s uncertainty invites simpler pleasures: perhaps a stroll down the waterfront to savor the crisp air and watch the fog dance over the harbor, or a quiet morning at a nearby caf\u00e9, indulging in a fragrant brew while the city transitions into the rhythm of the day. While outdoor plans may feel muted, finding joy in the small moments, wrapped in the embrace of a cozy sweater, might prove the perfect antidote to the drizzly forecast.",
