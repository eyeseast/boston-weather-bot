    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, a gentle warmth embraces the city, with the sun casting a gold-tinted glow on the vibrant autumn landscape. With a high hovering around 69 degrees, this moment evokes a palette of deep oranges and scarlets painted against the canvas of a mostly sunny sky. The breeze carries the fresh scent of fallen leaves, making it an ideal time for a leisurely stroll through the Public Garden, where the tranquility of nature offers a welcome escape from the urban bustle.\n\nHowever, as twilight approaches, the air thickens with anticipation; clouds begin to weave through the sky, hinting at the possibility of rain showers after midnight. With a low settling near 56 degrees, the night will usher in a more humid embrace, making an extra layer essential for those venturing out. One might enjoy a cozy coffee at a nearby caf\u00e9 or take in the soft glimmer of the city lights reflecting on the Charles River, savoring that fleeting moment of warmth before the rain arrives. \n\nSo dress in light layers to accommodate the shift in temperature and keep an ear tuned for the sounds of evening rain\u2014leaving behind the day\u2019s warmth while welcoming the whispers of the night.",
