    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Boston, an enveloping cloak of fog settles over the city, accompanied by the gentle promise of rain. The atmosphere is thick with a tapestry of muted grays and shadowy outlines, evoking a sense of stillness and mystery. With temperatures resting around a cool 43 degrees, a modest southeast wind stirs, whispering softly through the streets. The chance of rain dances around a suave 80 percent, hinting at the onset of gentle showers that may tend to linger throughout the early hours.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the fog to persist, mingling with the rain until late morning, when the clouds will remain, casting a somber veil over the landscape. The high will inch toward a crisp 49, and gusts may gustily remind one of the weather's fickleness. Attire that welcomes layering would be wise\u2014perhaps a light raincoat paired with a cozy sweater beneath\u2014bringing both comfort and modulation against the cool, damp air. With the ambiance suggesting a day best spent indoors, one might relish the simple joy of curling up with a book in a favorite nook or indulging in a warm cup of coffee at a local caf\u00e9, letting the world outside blur into a watercolor of muted colors and soft sounds, reverberating with the quietude of a rainy day in this storied city.",
