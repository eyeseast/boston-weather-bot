    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Boston unfolds under a hazy sky, a gentle veil that softens the edges of the city. Partly sunny patches may peer through, promising a high that flirts with the warmth of 71 degrees. An east wind whispers through the streets, offering a subdued touch of coolness that beckons those living in the moment to step outside. As dusk approaches, the haze will deepen, giving way to the possibility of patchy fog, particularly between late evening hours when the city shifts gears and prepares for night.\n\nWith temperatures dipping to around 55 by nightfall, a light jacket would provide comfort against the coolness that rolls in with the darkness. It\u2019s a perfect evening to stroll along the waterfront, where the sounds of the waves mingle with the distant city hum, or to find a cozy nook in a local caf\u00e9, perhaps with a book in hand or good conversation brewing over steaming mugs. Simple pleasures seem to call amidst the haze\u2014this is an evening for quiet enjoyment, as the city prepares to wrap itself in the embrace of a foggy night.",
