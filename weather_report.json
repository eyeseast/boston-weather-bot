    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the sun graces the city with a reluctant warmth, casting a gentle light against the backdrop of a crisp winter sky. The air holds a restrained chill but hints at a transition as warmer winds begin to stir from the south. As the day moves toward dusk, anticipation hangs thick with the looming promise of freezing rain, cloaked beneath a growing blanket of clouds. Tonight will usher in a notable shift; the temperature will dip into the low 30s, but beneath the cover of night, it will creep back up as the atmosphere softens, suggesting the onset of rain amidst the icy embrace.\n\nTo navigate these shifting conditions, one might dress with layers in mind\u2014perhaps a light sweater beneath a sturdy coat, complemented by a warm scarf to ward off the initial bite of the day and a dependable umbrella close at hand. While today\u2019s sunny moments beckon for a stroll through the city\u2019s parks or along the waterfront, it would be wise to savor those steps early; soon, the rain may wash over your plans. Instead, embrace the allure of a cozy caf\u00e9, where you can sip a warm drink and bask in the glow of company as the world outside turns progressively drearier.",
