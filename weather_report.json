    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun hangs in the sky above Boston, a gentle warmth envelops the city, preparing for a change that whispers of evening rain. The clouds gather, billowing softly, casting a muted light that bathes the surroundings in a hushed glow. A light breeze stirs, carrying with it the promise of cooling moisture, as temperatures dip gradually from their afternoon high. The air holds a touch of humidity, suggesting that this typical New England day may soon yield to the rhythmic sounds of distant thunder. The forecast hints at showers and the potential for thunderstorms later, making it a perfect time to settle in somewhere comfortable.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the once vibrant blue of day softens, and the forecasted fog begins to weave through the landscape. For those venturing out, a light jacket or a sweater will suffice as the temperature will linger gently around the cool 58 degrees. However, carry an umbrella or a water-resistant layer; the chance of rain is palpable, beckoning individuals to shift their plans either indoors for a cozy evening with a book or a board game, or perhaps to a local caf\u00e9 to relish a warm drink while the rain dances against the windows. The day, while not purely joyful, holds a serene charm\u2014quiet and contemplative\u2014inviting one to embrace the changing scenery.",
