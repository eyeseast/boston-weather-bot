    "weather_report": "The night air in Boston carries a crisp chill, with temperatures dipping to around 22, cloaking the city in a tranquil stillness. A Northwest breeze whispers through the streets, enhancing the sense of solitude that blankets the midnight hour. As the city holds its breath, the skies are mostly clear, unmarred by fog or mist; rather, they offer a gentle expanse, inviting nighttime wanderers to embrace the peace of the hour.\n\nCome morning, the sun will rise with a brilliant intent, casting a warm glow on the frost-kissed landscape and hinting at a high of 32. With a soft West wind supporting the sun's ascent, the day promises to unfold beautifully. To navigate this winter's charm, dressing in layers will be key: a snug scarf, a warm coat, perhaps a felted hat to ward off the crisp air, will accompany your morning journey. Whether you choose a quiet stroll along the Charles River or a serene visit to a tucked-away caf\u00e9, the day's invitation is one to relish the beauty of winter in the city. The prospect of sunlit buildings reflecting off icy sidewalks creates a canvas worth stepping into, urging you to find delight in the mundane pleasures of a winter day.",
