    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds in Boston, a shroud of clouds blankets the city, casting a muted light that struggles to pierce through the persistent rain. The air is thick with anticipation as droplets cling to windowpanes and the scent of wet earth wafts through the streets. The temperature hovers around a mild 65 degrees, but the sensation of dampness may make it feel a touch chillier. Winds from the south stir gently, but they lack the warmth that would typically accompany such a breeze. With a 100% chance of rain predicted to last until early afternoon, the day\u2019s plan should account for the steady showers, perhaps by seeking refuge in one of Boston's cozy cafes or indulging in a spirited visit to a local museum.\n\nAs night approaches, the forecast holds a promise of clearer skies, giving way to a cooler evening that will settle around 44 degrees. The earlier rain will give way to a calm, partly cloudy night, best suited for a leisurely stroll beneath the stars once the dampness dissipates. For today\u2019s attire, layers are essential\u2014a reliable raincoat or umbrella, perhaps paired with comfortable shoes that can withstand the wet pavements. As the city awakens to this somber yet refreshing weather, nurturing a spirit of cozy contemplation is the order of the day, prompting one to find solace in the warmth of indoor activities, or to embrace the rain with a gentle resolve as they traverse the city's vibrant landscape amidst the rain.",
