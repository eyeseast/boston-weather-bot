    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Boston, a blanket of clouds lingers overhead, softly dimming the early morning light. The air sits comfortably at a cool 58 degrees, hinting at the gentle shifts of an eastern breeze, still meek in its arrival. While the city begins to awaken, the forecast foretells a day graced by the likelihood of rain showers. Between the hours of 9 AM and 5 PM, expect a hazy veil of moisture to unfold, perhaps whispering through the streets with the promise of less than a tenth of an inch of gentle rainfall. By afternoon, the atmosphere will be cloaked in a shroud of fog, giving the day an almost ethereal quality.\n\nAs the rains hover on the horizon, attire with layers becomes more than a suggestion; a light coat or rain jacket would serve you well in this damp embrace of the day. Comfortable shoes suitable for occasional puddles and a simple scarf to shield against the chill may very well make your endeavors outdoors more pleasant. With the changing skies, a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 would be an inviting refuge, allowing you to relish a warm beverage while the world outside dances with raindrops, or a reflective stroll along the Freedom Trail might offer a solitary peace amid the whispers of the city. While the sunlight will likely shy away today, let the muted tones of the rainy moments inspire a peaceful rhythm to your routine.",
