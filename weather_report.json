    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Boston, the city glows beneath a canvas of starlit serenity, punctuated by the distant sparkle of streetlights and the gentle hum of life. The night is mostly clear, with a cool breath wafting through the streets, hinting at the chill that accompanies the low temperature hovering around the mid-twenties. A light wind from the west whispers softly through the air, creating a refreshing yet brisk atmosphere that encourages you to wrap up warmly in layers.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the promise of a bright day lingers on the horizon. The sun will make a splendid appearance, casting golden rays over the city, with temperatures climbing toward the late fifties. Under the embrace of a gentle southwest wind, this Sunday invites leisurely strolls through the parks or perhaps a visit to a favorite caf\u00e9, where one can sip hot coffee and indulge in hearty pastries. As the day unfolds, dressing in warm yet light layers will be essential; a cozy sweater paired with a jacket will balance the brisk morning air with the delightful warmth of the afternoon sun. It\u2019s a day that suggests a quiet joy in simple pleasures, whether that be a quiet read by a sunny window or a stroll along the Charles, taking in the fall beauty as it begins to fade.",
