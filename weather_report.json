    "weather_report": "As the quiet of night envelops Boston, a soft veil of patchy fog whispers over the city, mingling with the remnants of earlier showers. A gentle wind carries the scent of damp earth, hinting at nature's slow awakening. With temperatures hovering in the low fifties, the air holds a coolness that might prompt a light jacket or perhaps a cozy sweater draped over one\u2019s shoulders. One may hear the distant hum of the city, punctuated by spirits wandering home and the occasional chirp of a nightingale. \n\nAs dawn breaks, anticipation builds for the day ahead. Friday promises to lift the gray gloom, revealing splashes of sunlight breaking through the cloudiness, washing over streets with the warmth of a gentle embrace. A high near sixty-five invites exploration of Boston\u2019s bustling neighborhoods or a leisurely stroll along the Charles River. For those venturing out, comfortable layers are advisable to adapt to the shifting temperatures, perhaps topped off with a light scarf for charm. Outdoor caf\u00e9s beckon for herbal teas or fresh pastries while the soft breeze whispers tales of the day yet to unfold. Engaging with the city\u2019s rich tapestry in these transitional moments, one might find joy in the simple act of watching clouds drift or listening to the laughter of friends nearby.",
