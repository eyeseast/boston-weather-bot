    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, the city awakens under a vast expanse of mostly sunny skies, though the chill of winter lingers in the air. The temperature has gently settled, hovering near 40, though it promises to dip into the thirties this afternoon, beckoning residents to wrap themselves in layers that embrace both warmth and comfort. A brisk northwest wind dances through the streets, whipping against the facades of buildings, sowing a touch of energy into the quiet of the early hour. The gusts, reminiscent of the vigor that makes this city resilient, may take even the most seasoned Bostonian by surprise.\n\nTonight brings the solace of clarity as the skies will remain clear and crisp, with temperatures dropping to a whisper of 15 degrees. It\u2019s the kind of evening that invites a cozy nook, perhaps with a warm drink in hand, offering an escape from the briskness outdoors. Dressing in layers\u2014think a sturdy coat, gloves, and a snug scarf\u2014will not only keep one warm but amplify the pleasure of a late afternoon stroll through the parks adorned with remnants of winter. With the clarity of the day, wandering the winding pathways of the Emerald Necklace could prove both invigorating and peaceful, providing a perfect opportunity to witness the slow transition of the sun as it bows out of the day.",
