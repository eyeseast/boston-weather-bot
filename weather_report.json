    "weather_report": "As night drapes itself over Boston, the air carries a crispness that hints at the chill of November settling in. The sky, mostly cloudy, offers a muted backdrop for the city\u2019s twinkling lights. Temperatures hover around a cool 35 degrees, with a gentle south wind whispering through the streets, barely stirring leaves from their post.\n\nTomorrow, Thanksgiving Day unfolds under a heavy cloud cover, promising to drench the city in a steady rain beginning after the breakfast hour. The forecast speaks of temperatures reaching a modest 47 degrees, accompanied by winds rising from a soft breeze to a brisk 16 mph, lending a chill that could cut through even the coziest of layers. With a 100% chance of precipitation, it's prudent to don a waterproof coat, perhaps with a scarf wrapped snugly around the neck and an umbrella steadfastly in hand. Those venturing out could find a delightful afternoon scavenging the local coffee shops, finding warmth in a hot drink while watching droplets dance on windowpanes. Given the dreary forecast, an afternoon of quiet reflection with a good book or a cozy gathering with friends might be in order, allowing one to embrace the warmth of connection despite the chilly and wet embrace of Boston's weather.",
