    "weather_report": "As the clock softly chimes past midnight, Boston slumbers beneath a shroud of clouds, punctuated only by the distant twinkling lights that glimmer against the inky sky. A gentle breeze whispers through, barely stirring the leaves, while the temperature settles comfortably in the upper fifties. The faint scent of impending rain hangs in the air, mingling with the nostalgia of a city rich with history and stories untold. With a 50% chance of rain showers lurking just beyond dawn, the waking hours promise a gray awakening, wrapped in a cloak of humidity and whispers of fog that may curl through the early light.\n\nThe day ahead anticipates a mostly cloudy disposition, with rain showers likely flirting with the horizon before 9 AM. The chance of precipitation rises to 60%, hinting at sporadic moisture that could make the pathways glisten, should they be graced by drops from above. For those venturing out, comfortable layers would be wise\u2014a light jacket against the cool breeze and perhaps an umbrella readily at hand. Activities could include a leisurely stroll through the serene confines of the Public Garden, where the fog might create an ethereal ambiance, or perhaps a visit to a cozy coffee shop where the aroma of fresh brews provides comfort against the damp. The day may not open its arms wide with sunshine, yet there exists a quiet charm to urban life when adorned in shades of gray.",
