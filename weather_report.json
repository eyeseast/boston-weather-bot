    "weather_report": "As the night wraps its muted embrace around Boston, a veil of fog shrouds the city, lending an air of mystery to the streets. The temperature rests gently around 63, with whispers of a slight chance for rain murmuring through the stillness. The soft rush of a south wind adds a touch of warmth, inviting those who venture out to wear layers that capture both comfort and a dash of adventure. Expect the flickering glow of streetlights to soften as dawn approaches, merging with the lingering haze.\n\nWith morning's arrival, the fog will begin to part, revealing a partly sunny disposition that promises delightful warmth, inching toward 84 by midday. The wind will commendably offer its spirited gusts, energizing all who meander through parks or along the Charles River. Slip into something light yet layered; perhaps a breezy shirt with a light jacket to guard against the morning chill. A stroll through the bustling streets, a casual coffee at your favorite caf\u00e9, or perhaps a gentle bike ride along scenic paths would perfectly capture the spirit of the day\u2014refreshing and inviting, allowing the city to unveil its early autumn charm.",
