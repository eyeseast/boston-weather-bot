    "weather_report": "As the evening settles gently over Boston, a curtain of cloud drifts in, wrapping the city in a muted embrace. The air is crisp, marked by a sharpness that hints at the coming chill, with temperatures nudging towards 14 degrees under a canvass of partially obscured stars. A light northwest breeze whispers through the streets, inviting those who venture out to don layers against the chill, perhaps a woolen scarf or a well-fitted jacket to ward off the bite of the winter air.\n\nLooking ahead to the morrow, clouds will thicken with a promise of snow late in the afternoon. The high will hover just below freezing, where the gray skies might bring a light dusting, beautiful in its delicate descent, though laden with the potential for slush underfoot. This is a perfect time to enjoy the quieter activities that a wintry day can inspire\u2014perhaps a late lunch at a cozy caf\u00e9, the kind where time slows over a cup of steaming tea; or a stroll along the river, where the world might reveal its serene beauty amidst the frosty tips of the trees. As dusk whispers its return, partake in the quiet wonder of a city cloaked in winter\u2019s embrace, where the breath of the night mingles with the soft glow of streetlamps.",
