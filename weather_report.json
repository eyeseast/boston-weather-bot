    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches over Boston, a gentle cloak of clouds spreads across the sky, creating an enigmatic veil that whispers of the day to come. The air remains warm, wrapped in a soft embrace of 62 degrees, inviting in its own understated manner. A north wind stirs lazily, barely reaching for two miles per hour, almost as if in a reluctant stretch from slumber. For those stirring from their night\u2019s respite, a hint of fog lingers, particularly around the edges of the water. As the early hours unfold, the world around is poised to awaken slowly, the fog dissipating just in time for a partly sunny disposition by late morning.\n\nAs the sun takes its rightful place, expect the temperature to rise towards a balmy 80, creating a day that, while quietly glorious, suggests fluid movement through the hours. Dress lightly in breathable fabrics to navigate the warmth, yet remain ever-prepared for that wispy layer of fog that could embrace your shoulders momentarily. It's a day that subtly beckons one to contemplate a stroll by the Esplanade or perhaps gather in the sunlit corners of a cozy caf\u00e9 with a book in hand. This is the sort of day that invites a leisurely pace, allowing you to savor the fleeting moments of late summer in the city, where the golden light and burgeoning warmth mingle like familiar friends.",
