    "weather_report": "A gentle warmth envelops Boston this afternoon, as the sun takes center stage behind a canvas of azure, punctuated by wispy clouds that drift lazily across the sky. The temperature, hovering around a comfortable 72 degrees, invites one to step outside and bask in the early spring light. The south winds, soft and soothing, sweep through the city, encouraging a leisurely stroll along the banks of the Charles or a quiet afternoon in one of the city's charming parks. \n\nAs twilight approaches, the scene will shift. Expect the vibrant hues of the day to fade into a more subdued palette; a patch of smoke likely to linger in the night air could cast a veil over the evening, supporting the banks of low clouds that are forecast to gather. With temperatures dipping to a cool 53 in the late hours, a light sweater or jacket will serve you well should you find yourself outside. Tonight may be an opportune moment to explore the hidden nooks of Boston's neighborhoods: the allure of a local caf\u00e9, perhaps, or a quiet corner for reading that has long been overlooked. There\u2019s much to appreciate in these transitional hours, lending the evening an air of calm that accompanies the soft hum of the city winding down.",
