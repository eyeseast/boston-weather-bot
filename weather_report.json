    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the afternoon unfolds under a bracing, mostly sunny sky, inviting those who wander through the streets to breathe in deeply the crisp air. A high temperature near 62 degrees complements the stirring breeze, which races in from the northwest, occasionally gusting with delightful exuberance. As the sun casts its golden light, shadows dance along the pavement, hinting at the day\u2019s tranquil nature, perfect for a leisurely stroll or perhaps a quiet sit on a park bench with a good book in hand.\n\nAs evening approaches, the skies will remain clear and open, giving way to a serene twilight where the temperature dips to a mellow 38 degrees. For those stepping out later, a light jacket is advisable, perhaps layered over a soft sweater. Such conditions present a wonderful opportunity to explore local cafes or perhaps linger outside to relish the transition from day to night, allowing the gentle winds to carry away the day\u2019s concerns. As dusk cloaks the city, the warmth of a hot drink and the spirit of adventure could weave together into a comforting embrace against the cool evening air.",
