    "weather_report": "As the quiet hours unfurl over Boston, a hush blankets the city, allowing only the faintest whispers of the northwest breeze to intermingle with the cool, crisp air. The night sky, draped in layers of clouds, hints at the chill that lingers, with temperatures expected to dip into the low twenties. With dawn's arrival, a modest promise of sunshine dances on the horizon, teasing the day ahead with the possibility of warmth as the sun stretches its rays, soon to rise near 47 degrees. However, as afternoon approaches, temperatures are destined to retreat, settling back to around 40 under a gentle southwest wind.\n\nIn this transitional weather, one might opt for a layered ensemble\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater beneath a sturdy jacket, perfectly suited for the nippy morning air and the later day's retreat into coolness. The day invites a leisurely stroll through the Boston Commons, where the emerging sunlight bathes the trees in a soft glow, or perhaps a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9, the warmth of its interior beckoning as you sip on a perfectly brewed warm beverage. While the day may not burst with the vibrancy of summer, it offers its own charms; a chance to enjoy the gentle awakening of the city, harmonized by the symphony of early-morning life.",
