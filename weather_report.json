    "weather_report": "As twilight weaves its veil over Boston, the atmosphere feels heavy and expectant, burdened with the promise of rain. The air is cool, around 47 degrees, inviting a layered approach to attire; a light jacket should serve well against the damp chill, paired perhaps with a cozy scarf to ward off the impending drizzle. The southwest winds whisper softly, a gentle prelude to the rain showers anticipated through the night. With an 80% chance of precipitation hanging in the air, those venturing out might find themselves dancing between droplets, a quiet symphony of nature's rhythms in the city streets.\n\nSaturday arrives with the possibility of lingering rain, yet hope glimmers through the clouds. Though the skies will likely remain draped in gray, a high near 60 suggests moments when warmth might pierce the gloom. Those familiar with Boston know to embrace spontaneity; a leisurely stroll along the Esplanade could yield delightful surprises, perhaps stopping at a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor a hot drink as you watch the world blur softly around you. As evening approaches once more, the city settles into a comforting embrace of warmth\u2014ideal for gathering with friends or indulging in a thoughtful evening of reading by a window, as the rain serenades the night.",
