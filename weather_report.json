    "weather_report": "As the sun hangs low in the afternoon sky above Boston, a gentle breeze stirs the air, carrying with it the promise of cooler times ahead. The clouds drift lazily, casting a muted light over the city, as temperatures settle near 58 degrees. The west wind whispers like an old friend, making the outdoors feel just brisk enough to remind us of the fleeting warmth of spring. As the day wanes, dark clouds gather their strength, hinting at the rain showers that will soon dance across the rooftops and cobblestones, ushering in a night filled with drizzles and the lingering touch of fog.\n\nFor those venturing outdoors, a sweater or light jacket would serve well against the chill to come, especially as evening approaches and the thermometer dips toward that cool threshold. For the more intrepid souls, consider seeking refuge in a cozy caf\u00e9, where the rich scents of freshly brewed coffee intertwine with the muffled sounds of rain tapping against the window, creating a perfect backdrop for quiet contemplation or an engaging read. It\u2019s an evening to savor the simple pleasures, perhaps indulging in a warm pastry while the city is wrapped in the embrace of a gentle fog, blurring the edges of the vibrant urban landscape into something almost dreamlike.",
