    "weather_report": "As the sun climbs higher in the Boston sky this morning, the air embraces a crispness that whispers of autumn\u2019s lingering touch. Today unfolds under a canvas of mostly sunny skies, radiating a brightness that cuts through the chill, though a gentle northeastern breeze carries with it a hint of the coolness that will settle in by afternoon. The day promises to be a dance of highs around a modest 55, dipping softly to nestle around 49 in the afternoon, while the clouds begin to tease their arrival later tonight, hinting at a chance of rain after three, with temperatures sliding to around a brisk 42.\n\nFor those stepping outdoors, layers will serve well against the shifting chill. A warm sweater or a light jacket will provide comfort during the day, while scarves may come in handy later as the air grows heavier with moisture. The promise of rain encroaches, inviting a walk through the city's historic streets, perhaps a visit to a quaint coffee shop where the steam rises in lazy spirals, or an afternoon spent exploring the myriad art galleries that the city has to offer. As the day edges toward dusk, nestled in the warmth of your favorite spot, you may find solace in watching the light fade, pondering what tomorrow may bring.",
