    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Boston, the sky envelops the city in a mantle of clarity, marked only by the occasional whisper of clouds drifting by. The temperature, settling around a brisk 28 degrees, invites a sense of stillness punctuated by the gentle west wind, which rustles through the streets at a steady pace, gusting at times with a hint of vigor. It\u2019s a night that feels crisp yet invigorating, a reminder that winter is firmly in its grasp.\n\nTomorrow dawns with promise, as the sun will awaken to cast its golden rays upon the city, elevating the day\u2019s warmth to a modest 38 degrees. With the wind at a more moderate 10 to 15 mph, it will feel distinctly pleasant, especially under the bright blue expanses of sky that will emerge. Residents might consider layering comfortably; a well-fitted coat paired with a soft scarf would serve well against the chill, while warm gloves will keep fingers toasty against the brisk air. On such a day, one might enjoy wandering the Freedom Trail, popping into a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink, or perhaps taking a leisurely stroll through one of the city parks, seeking the serenity that comes with this beautiful winter tableau.",
