    "weather_report": "As night settles over Boston, the air hangs heavy with the promise of rain, a soothing, persistent rhythm that softly patters against the pavement. The temperatures dip down into the chilly realms, calling for warm layers and perhaps a thick scarf for those venturing outside. The sky, a blanket of clouds obscuring the stars, casts a muted glow over the city, where streetlights flicker like fireflies trapped in glass. The rain, destined to arrive shortly, may linger through the night, making for a cozy atmosphere if you find solace indoors with a warm drink and a good book.\n\nTomorrow greets us with a whisper of hope: the chance of rain dissipates by morning, giving way to a sun peeking timidly through scattered clouds. The day promises a brisk high, invigorating, albeit in the lower range, compelling one to embrace layers\u2014perhaps a simple wool sweater against the cool breeze. Crisp air encourages brisk walks through empty parks or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the glow of the espresso machine provides warmth to match the coffee's embrace. In this season of pauses, Boston offers both quiet reflection and the simple pleasure of a rain-soaked evening followed by a brightening day, a reminder of the gentle cycle of nature.",
