    "weather_report": "In Boston, the day unfolds beneath a veil of muted grays, hinting at the promise of snow showers that linger in the morning air. The city's skyline, softened by the cloud cover, seems almost contemplative against the low-hanging clouds. As the day progresses, temperatures will hover around a modest 38 degrees, accompanied by gentle winds that whisper rather than howl. This isn\u2019t a day to venture out in shorts; layered clothing will be your ally\u2014consider a warm sweater topped with a reliable jacket. Sturdy boots may also serve you well in case of stray snowflakes that dance through the air.\n\nAs we move into tonight, the clouds will part slightly to reveal a bit more clarity, ushering in a chill that will settle down to around 25 degrees. It would be wise to close out the evening with a warm drink in hand, perhaps meandering through the quieter streets, where the world feels just a touch more intimate in the evening stillness. The ambiance lends itself to cozy gatherings, whether you find yourself at a small bistro or nestled at home with a good book. Embrace the subtle allure of the day; while not bursting with sunshine or vibrant colors, it carries with it a certain calmness worth savoring.",
