    "weather_report": "Tonight in Boston, a tranquil stillness envelops the city. The skies are mostly clear, allowing for a nice expanse of visibility, broken only by the crisp chill that the night brings. A northwest wind carries whispers of frost, beckoning you to layer up appropriately. With temperatures dipping to around a chilling twelve degrees, one should reach for a warm coat, perhaps a snug scarf, and gloves to ward off the bite of the wind.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, the dawn will bring mostly sunny skies, hinting at a refreshing brightness that balances the cold. However, be prepared to contend with a formidable wind chill, as the temperatures may feel as low as zero. A gentle north wind will persist throughout the day, adding a brisk edge to your strolls around the neighborhood. This combination of raw air and bright sunlight provides an opportunity for a brisk walk through one of Boston's many parks or an outing to a cozy caf\u00e9, where a warming cup of tea or coffee can be the perfect antidote to the chill. As you move through the city, let the fresh air revive your senses, ideal for a day spent among the city's charm, wrapped in warmth and a good book.",
