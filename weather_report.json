    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Boston, a gentle brightness permeates the landscape. The sky, a canvas brushed with soft shades of blue, speaks of a fleeting winter warmth as the sun arcs toward its zenith. Temperatures hover invitingly around thirty-eight degrees, while a tender east wind teases the senses with its mildness. The day appears mostly sunny, though in the ensuing hours, clouds will gather like whispers of an impending chill, ushering in a nighttime low around twenty-six.\n\nFor those journeying outside, a light sweater or a warm coat may suffice against the cool embrace of the breeze. This is no time for heavy layers, but rather a chance to savor a pleasant walk along the waterfront or perhaps to explore one of the city\u2019s quaint cafes, where the rich aroma of coffee beckons amidst the cool air. As evening approaches, the clouds may dull the palette of twilight, but the lingering memories of a sunlit day remain, inviting introspection and quiet moments of respite against what lies ahead.",
