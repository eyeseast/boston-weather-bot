    "weather_report": "As the sun casts its warm embrace over Boston this afternoon, the sky stretches into an endless expanse of blue, punctuated only by wispy clouds lazily drifting by. The air, saturated with warmth and a hint of summer's languor, hints at the day\u2019s peak of 98 degrees, with a heat index nudging towards a sweltering 101. A gentle westward breeze joins the scene, bringing with it fleeting moments of relief, yet one would be wise to remain hydrated and cautious of the sun's relentless rays.\n\nAs dusk settles in, the warmth will recede ever so slightly, promising a more temperate evening with temperatures dipping to a comfortable 71. Night will unfold under a canopy of stars, with the gentle whispers of a cool north wind inviting those who seek a peaceful twilight stroll. The air will still carry traces of the day's lingering heat, so light clothing remains a prudent choice. A simple outing, perhaps to sip iced tea on a terrace or to explore a quiet corner of the city, would make for an ideal conclusion to an increasingly pleasant summer day.",
