A light jacket will serve you well as the temperatures dip down, wrapping around you just enough to ward off the chill. With nothing but a light breeze whispering through the streets, there's an opportunity for small delight in simple pleasures\u2014a sip of warm cider at a neighborhood caf\u00e9 or an impromptu gathering with friends under the stars. Today, Boston sparkles subtly, beckoning residents to savor its understated beauty amidst the bustling vibrance of the city.",
