With a high expected near 45, the sun promises to warm the brisk air, a gentle northwest breeze whispering through the streets at a leisurely pace. Tonight, the sky will remain mostly clear, inviting a soothing stillness that ushers in a night with temperatures dipping to a cozy 27, perfect for a soft blanket while relaxing indoors.\n\nAs you step out, consider embracing layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater over a long-sleeve shirt, accompanied by a warm jacket to fend off the chill of the north wind. A suitable scarf and a comfortable pair of shoes will aid in navigating the pedestrian avenues, where a stroll might reveal hidden caf\u00e9s beckoning for a warm drink or the inviting aroma of fresh pastries. It\u2019s a day best spent enjoying simple pleasures: a leisurely walk along the river, a visit to a quaint bookstore, or brunch at a local diner where time seems to pause just long enough to savor life.",
