    "weather_report": "As the night envelops Boston, the city lies under a cloak of quiet stillness, punctuated only by the gentle hum of distant traffic and the soft glow of urban lights reflecting against the darkened sky. The earlier hours witnessed scattered showers, now but a memory, leaving the air crisp and brisk, perfect for a long evening stroll or a cozy retreat indoors. With temperatures dipping into the chilly embrace of the late autumn air, a layer of warmth\u2014a sturdy sweater or jacket\u2014would be a wise companion for this night out.\n\nAs we look forward to tomorrow, the promise of a mostly sunny day beckons, though with a cooler high lingering just around the 50-degree mark. The brisk northwest wind will carry the whispers of the past rainfall, offering a fresh perspective on the world. Consider embarking on a leisurely morning walk before the bustle of the day settles in, perhaps to visit a local caf\u00e9 for warm coffee or tea, where the scent of pastries coaxes one to linger just a moment longer. If you're feeling adventurous, a quiet afternoon in one of the many parks, wrapped in a blanket with a favorite book, could be just the remedy for a weary spirit. Should you venture out, remember to dress thoughtfully, allowing the crisp wind to invigorate your senses while keeping comfort close at hand.",
