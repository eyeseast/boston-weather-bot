    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Boston, a veil of clouds gathers, setting the stage for the rain anticipated to arrive after 10 PM. The air is thick with humidity, and a balmy breeze stirs from the south, whispering promises of the more substantial rainfall to come. The temperature, languidly resting around the mid-fifties, invites you to seek warmth in layers\u2014perhaps a soft sweater or a light jacket will serve you well against the chill that accompanies the wind gusting at times to nearly thirty-five miles per hour. \n\nTomorrow, rain will dominate the landscape. One can expect an overcast sky, cloaked in shades of gray, with a high creeping near sixty. As the city draws closer to this forecasted downpour, you might feel inclined to tuck away in a cozy nook, perhaps wrapping your fingers around a steaming cup of tea, or indulging in the quiet comfort of a good book. Given the weather's propensity for gloom, this evening\u2014and indeed much of Monday\u2014may be most suitable for introspective evenings, perhaps attend a gallery exhibit or immerse yourself in the warmth of local cafes, absorbing the rhythm of life as the rain presents its symphony outside your window.",
