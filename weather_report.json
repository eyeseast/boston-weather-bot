    "weather_report": "As the clock creeps past midnight in Boston, the city rests under the embrace of a calm night, offering a crisp clarity, free from the encumbrance of fog. The air is light, teetering at a pleasant latitude, with temperatures settling around 59 degrees. A gentle northwest breeze whispers through the trees, a subtle reminder of nature\u2019s presence amidst urban life. \n\nAs dawn unfurls its wings, tomorrow promises to be mostly sunny, with the day ahead hinting at warmth as temperatures could reach a cozy 85 degrees. This shall be a day ideal for leisurely strolls through the park or perhaps sipping iced coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9 while enjoying the embrace of the gentle wind. Lightweight layers will serve best; a simple shirt paired with comfortable shorts or trousers will suffice as you navigate the inviting streets. With such enticing weather, one might consider revisiting that novel left on your nightstand, a blanket draped over your legs, or perhaps taking a long ride along the shore, savoring the tranquility that a sunlit July day beckons.",
