The air wraps around you with a cool whisper, making the moments spent outdoors feel intimate, yet mysterious. Though the sky remains mostly cloudy, those fleeting glimpses of stars hint at the potential for clarity as dawn approaches.\n\nBy morning, the fog will begin to lift, unveiling a partially sunny day that dances between warmth and coolness, a delightful balance. The gentle breeze from the northeast will accompany the sun as it climbs, promising an inviting atmosphere for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or quiet moments in one of the city\u2019s charming parks. In such comfortable conditions, light layering becomes your best attire\u2014perhaps a soft sweater or a light jacket to ward off the lingering chill of the morning before shedding it as the day grows pleasantly warm. A visit to a local caf\u00e9 to enjoy a warm drink while relishing the calm before the bustle of the day might just be the perfect indulgence. Take a moment; the city waits to share its beauty, hidden just beneath the veil of fog.",
