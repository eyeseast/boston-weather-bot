    "weather_report": "On this afternoon in Boston, the skies are draped in a gentle, muted veil; a soft sun peeks through, casting a pale light that warms the chill in the air. Though the temperature hovers near the cool end of the spectrum, the south breeze carries with it a comforting promise of crisp clarity. As the day drifts toward evening, clouds will deepen into a partial cover, ushering in a night that cools down to the low twenties, accentuated by a light westward wind. This transition invites a cozy ambiance, where warmth becomes a priority.\n\nAs you step out, a layer or two will serve you well; a warm coat paired with a knitted scarf would be an astute choice to keep the chill at bay. It\u2019s an ideal time for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River, wrapped in your favorite sweater, or perhaps savoring a hot drink at a local caf\u00e9, indulging in the cozy atmosphere that defines winter afternoons. These moments, though seemingly mundane, are painted with a tranquil beauty\u2014the kind that wraps around you like a favorite blanket, making even the simplest activities feel rich in warmth and understated charm.",
