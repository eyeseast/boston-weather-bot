    "weather_report": "The afternoon unfolds draped in shrouded clouds, as the Boston skyline succumbs to a gentle drizzle that brushes the pavement. Although the temperature hovers around a mild sixty-four, that warmth seems reluctant to penetrate the dampness that fills the air. A southwest breeze whispers through the trees, invigorating yet tinged with the bite of gusts strong enough to rustle thoughts and paper alike. The anticipation of rain looms heavily; you can almost hear the murmurs of its arrival in the quiet streets. This brief moment of rain before evening beckons one to seek refuge indoors, perhaps in the comfort of a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee can envelop you like a warm embrace.\n\nAs dusk settles, the chance of rain transitions to a mere whisper, with only a slight possibility of scattered showers lingering in the atmosphere. Tonight\u2019s cooler embrace, sinking down to fifty-two, calls for layers, inviting the donning of a light jacket to chase away the lingering chill. The clouds may obscure the stars, but they also cradle a sense of intimacy\u2014the perfect backdrop for a leisurely stroll through your neighborhood, the rhythmic patter of rain beneath your feet as your only companion. Dress comfortably and be prepared for some quick changes; those fleeting moments of clearness may inspire a visit to your favorite bookshop or art gallery. All in all, this blend of weather captures the quiet beauty of a day that brings a soothing, albeit melancholic, charm to the heart of the city.",
