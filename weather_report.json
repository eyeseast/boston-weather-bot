    "weather_report": "Morning breaks over Boston, bringing with it the promise of a serene day. The skies stretch overhead in an expanse of crystal blue, unmarred by clouds, reflecting the sunshine that bathes the city in a gentle warmth. As the sun ascends, it casts golden rays upon the bustling streets below, inviting residents to step outside and feel the brisk air infused with the scents of autumn. A northwest breeze whispers through the city, perfect for a brisk walk along the Charles River, where the waters shimmer in response to the daylight. \n\nAs afternoon approaches, expect a steady rise in the temperature, reaching a high near 56, a pleasant warmth tempered by the dance of wind gusts that remind one of the season's lingering chill. Tonight, the clear skies will reveal a tapestry of stars, while temperatures gently dip to around 36, offering a refreshing embrace as you prepare for the evening. Wrap yourself in a cozy sweater or light jacket if you venture out this evening, perhaps to savor a quiet moment at your favorite caf\u00e9 or to wander through the illuminated streets, relishing the charm of the city as it transitions into night. Today\u2019s conditions beckon to be enjoyed, whether diving into a leisurely lunch at an outdoor table or engaging in lighthearted conversation while discovering hidden nooks of beloved neighborhoods.",
