    "weather_report": "Afternoon settles softly over Boston, where the sun casts its warm embrace upon the city, painting the sky in shades of blue intermingled with fleecy clouds. Yet, beneath this cheerful fa\u00e7ade, the atmosphere hums with an undercurrent of potential energy; a chance of showers and thunderstorms lurks on the horizon, hinting at the possibility of the day becoming a tumultuous affair as evening approaches. Temperatures dance close to the 90-degree mark, but as the shadows lengthen, a retreat toward more comfortable mid-80s beckons. A light west wind whispers through the streets, barely nudging the unyielding heat. \n\nAs night settles in, the soft glow of the city lights will intermingle with the distant rumble of thunder, creating a backdrop of natural drama. With a low temperature settling around 64, individuals will find respite from the earlier warmth but should dress in layers. A light jacket might prove a wise companion, especially if one plans to linger outdoors as the day fades into a symphony of muted colors. Now is a spell to savor simple pleasures: perhaps a stroll to a favorite caf\u00e9 or a quiet corner of the park, where one can appreciate the transformation of the sky and listen for the distant patter of late-day raindrops. In this liminal space between sun and storm, the pulse of the city throbs softly, inviting woven moments of introspection or companionship over shared experiences.",
