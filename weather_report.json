    "weather_report": "As night descends upon Boston, the sky gently settles into a canvas of subtle, pastel tones, hinting at the warmth that lingers in the air\u2014an embrace of summer clinging to the fading daylight. It's a pleasant evening with temperatures holding steady around 66 degrees, and a light southwest breeze rustles through the early night, inviting outdoor pursuits under the unfolding stars. The horizon plays host to delicate, wispy clouds that suggest tranquility rather than turbulence, creating an ambiance perfect for a leisurely stroll by the Charles or an evening gathering on a friend\u2019s porch.\n\nTomorrow holds the promise of another steamy day, with the potential for midday rain showers and perhaps a rumble of thunder later in the afternoon. The anticipated high near 92 could make it feel quite sultry, so light layers will be your ally. A breathable fabric in shades of cool or light pastels will carry you through the warmth while keeping you prepared for the brief but intense moments of summer storms. As the day unfolds, consider venturing out, perhaps to a local cafe for an afternoon refreshment to escape the heat, or embrace the excitement of a spontaneous visit to a nearby art exhibit\u2014seeking shelter while nurturing a spark of creativity as the clouds gather their strength.",
