    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Boston unfolds with a gentle blessing of sunshine, painting the sky in a soft palette of blue and wispy clouds. The air whispers an invitation to step outside, where temperatures hover pleasantly around 57 degrees, kissed by a light southwest breeze that carries the earthy scent of autumn. As daylight begins to wane, the atmosphere teases the imminent change, with shadows lengthening and a chill creeping in as evening approaches.\n\nHowever, the serenity is poised for an abrupt transformation as rain is on the horizon, set to arrive after nightfall. Clouds gather their strength, promising a wet night with temperatures settling around 50 degrees, likely drenching the streets in a glossy sheen. It would be wise to wrap oneself in layers\u2014perhaps a comfortable sweater beneath a rain jacket, ensuring protection from the encroaching dampness. As the daylight fades and the clouds deepen, a quiet stroll or a leisurely coffee at a cozy caf\u00e9 might be the ideal way to appreciate the day's fading light before the rains begin. With the potential for less than gentle showers later, perhaps a visit to a local gallery or a contemplative read in the warmth of home would suit the mood as the evening unfolds.",
