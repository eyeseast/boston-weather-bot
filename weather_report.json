    "weather_report": "In Boston this afternoon, the sun bathes the city in a warm, golden light, with a cooling breeze that whispers of autumn\u2019s embrace. As the temperature holds steady around the mid-seventies, the sky is clear, a brilliant expanse of blue punctuated by a few clouds lazily drifting by. With the west wind gently stirring at about seventeen miles per hour, there\u2019s an invigorating freshness to the air. Later, as evening settles in, the city will transform under a mostly clear sky, inviting you to relish the crispness of the evening that may drop to a refreshing forty-five degrees, perfect for a light jacket.\n\nAs you contemplate your attire, consider layers\u2014a comfortable, long-sleeve shirt paired with a cozy sweater will keep you snug against the evening chill. For those inclined to venture outside, the ambiance is well-suited for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River or exploring one of Boston\u2019s many parks. It\u2019s the kind of day that sings of late fall, with leaves crunching underfoot and a tapestry of colors adorning the trees, making the city feel alive with a subtle vibrancy.",
