    "weather_report": "As the night envelops Boston, the air carries a sharpness that cuts through the lingering clouds, whispering of the chill that lies just beyond the warmth of home. A brisk wind dances through the streets, urging you to bundle up tightly. The temperature hovers around a biting twenty-one degrees, a reminder of the season's relentless grip. A hint of the day\u2019s brightness stirs anticipation for tomorrow, when the sun will rise, painting the city in golden warmth and promising a high near thirty-two. Those who venture out will feel the vigor of a westward breeze, a playful tease of a warmer day ahead.\n\nImagine stepping outside, your breath hanging in the air like a fleeting thought, and though the night\u2019s cover may seem dismal, a sense of quiet potential fills the atmosphere. This weekend may be perfect for a jaunt to the local caf\u00e9 or a leisurely wander through a nearby park, all while wrapped comfortably in your coziest layers. As the morning sun breaks through the clouds, the radiance will not only illuminate the city but also invigorate the spirits of its dwellers, beckoning them to embrace the outdoors anew. Until then, find solace in the warmth of home and the promise that tomorrow's sunlight will lift the veil of winter's chill.",
