    "weather_report": "As the clock strikes midnight in Boston, a cloak of fog embraces the city, whispering of rain to come. The air is thick and soft, carrying the unmistakable scent of a damp spring night, with the promise of showers unfurling before dawn. As you stir in the quiet hours, the low murmur of thunder may weave through your dreams, a subtle reminder that the day ahead will be marked by cloud cover and the occasional flash of lightning. Morning will greet the city with continued fog and intermittent showers\u2014an invitation to don layers that protect against the chill as well as the dampness. A light jacket or waterproof coat would serve you well, paired with comfortable shoes that can handle the wet pavement.\n\nAs the day unfolds into a muted gray, with temperatures hovering in the mid-sixties, the bustling rhythm of Boston will best be met with indoor pursuits. Perhaps a late breakfast at a favorite caf\u00e9, warmed by the steam of strong coffee, where you can observe the rain mingle with the chatter of the morning crowd. Or a leisurely stroll through a gallery, where the art might spark inspiration against the backdrop of the stormy skies outside. Remember to embrace the cozy charm of the day; while the weather may deter outdoor plans, it also offers a chance to retreat into spaces that feel warm and inviting. Seek comfort in the rhythm of rain on glass, the gentle sigh of the city welcoming its next chapter.",
