    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Boston, a soft veil of patchy fog drifts through the air, mingling with a slight chance of rain that may linger into the night. The atmosphere carries a cool whisper, inviting you to tuck away in layers against the faint chill that drags down to the low thirties. A moderate southwest breeze dances through the streets, reminding us that even the nighttime holds a certain vigor. With a mere brush of cloud cover overhead, the city\u2019s lights twinkle like distant stars, creating a quiet charm amidst the early night.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the fog will lift, paving the way for a splendid sunny day bathed in gentle warmth as the temperature edges closer to the mid-forties. The West wind will add a playful edge, caressing your cheeks as it gusts, encouraging outdoor pursuits. In this golden light, dress in several layers\u2014perhaps a keen sweater beneath a lighter jacket\u2014to strike the perfect balance of comfort and resilience. A stroll through Boston Common could be a delightful way to embrace the invigorating air, or a cozy afternoon in a local caf\u00e9 could beckon, inviting you to sip a warm beverage while watching life trot by in this vibrant city.",
