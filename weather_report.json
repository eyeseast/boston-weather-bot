    "weather_report": "In Boston, the morning unfolds under a heavy blanket of cloud, the kind that yawns out over the horizon like a whispered secret. This demeanor hints at a day destined for rain, a shroud that will not lift as the hours progress. By noon, the soft patter of rain will begin to echo against windows, drawing the city\u2019s inhabitants indoors for warmth and comfort. The chill in the air nudges us towards warmer garments\u2014perhaps a sturdy jacket layered over a cozy sweater, accompanied by a well-loved pair of waterproof boots, perfect for splashing through puddles that will inevitably form. \n\nAs the afternoon light dims, and the rain persists, there's an undeniable cozy allure to staying in with a book or indulging in the warmth of a caf\u00e9, where the steam from a hot coffee might momentarily fog your glasses. The evening brings a gentle continuation of the drizzle, with the air feeling thick and soft\u2014a perfect backdrop for quiet reflection or a solitary evening walk under the muted glow of street lamps. Yet there lies also the charm of community gatherings in snug corners of the city, where the rain is a distant murmur, and laughter thrives amid the clinking of cups and the rustling of pages. Bostonians will find a way to nestle into this rainy day, cradled between the comforts of home and the tantalizing promise of stories to be shared.",
