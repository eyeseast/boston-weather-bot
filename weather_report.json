    "weather_report": "As the quiet of the night envelops Boston, the air carries with it hints of moisture, promising that today may unfold under a veil of patchy fog and a gentle drizzle. The temperature edges downwards to a comfortably cool embrace, hinting at the arrival of early spring whispers. In this atmospheric tapestry, the winds behave modestly, teasingly swaying at around seven miles per hour, as the city readies itself for the subtle interplay of clouds and possible raindrops.\n\nThe day ahead is likely to continue this motif, with the fog lingering like a soft shroud, allowing for moments of clarity beneath the muted sky. A slight chance of rain showers lingers in the air, but this will be more an annoyance than a deluge \u2014 brief interludes in an otherwise gray tableau. As the temperatures shift from a high near 72 to a cooler 65, it is wise to dress in layers; a light jacket might prove a faithful companion against the chill, while comfortable shoes could carry you across the dampened sidewalks. Engage in a leisurely stroll through one of Boston's parks or perhaps duck into a cozy caf\u00e9, where the steam of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the brisk air outside. Today is not one to push for grand adventures, but rather to find quiet joys in the simple pleasures that this misty day offers.",
