    "weather_report": "In Boston, the daylight unfurls under a tapestry of cerulean skies, a perfect backdrop for the summer warmth that swells around 96 degrees. While the sun shines with an earnest clarity, an underlying heat beckons caution, nudging the heat index closer to a comforting embrace of nearly 98. With a gentle easterly breeze whispering through, the day carries with it an inviting charm, though mirages of humidity may hint at a certain stickiness that lingers in the air. As evening descends, the mercury will retreat to a snug 69 degrees, allowing for a refreshing reprieve under partly cloudy skies, signaling the perfect moment for unwinding after a sultry day.\n\nEmbracing this balmy embrace, one might consider light, breathable fabrics, perhaps a short-sleeved shirt paired with comfortable shorts for daytime wanderings. As the sun begins to dim, a light sweater could serve as a delightful companion for those outdoor caf\u00e9s or strolls along the harbor. Given the day\u2019s embrace of warmth and clarity, one might find joy in leisurely walks through Boston Common, picnicking amidst the shade of age-old trees, or enjoying a quiet moment at a local bookstore, basking in the ambient hum of afternoon conversations. Today offers a unique blend of simple pleasures, a tribute to the beauty of a summer's day in the heart of the city.",
