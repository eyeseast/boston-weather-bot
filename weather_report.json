    "weather_report": "As the quiet of the night drapes over Boston, a gentle whisper of wind stirs the stillness, with temperatures drifting comfortably around 57 degrees. The air is crisp, carrying the subtle scent of summer\u2019s lingering warmth, while the northeast breeze rustles softly against the dew-kissed grass. Glistening lights from distant buildings flicker like stars scattered across the darkened landscape, casting a serene glow on the evening\u2019s tranquility.\n\nTomorrow promises a sun-drenched day, with the golden orb rising to bask the city in warmth near 80 degrees. The light breeze will be a welcoming companion, caressing the skin just enough to remind you that summer lingers a while longer. The afternoon is ripe for embarking on leisurely strolls along the Charles River, where the shimmering water reflects the brilliance of a vibrant sky. Lightweight layers would be prudent; perhaps a light sweater to pair with a comfortable shirt, accommodating both the gentle warmth of the sun and the refreshing touches of wind. Framing your day with a literary distraction at a quaint caf\u00e9 or a visit to a local park would suit the mood, inviting you to savor the simple pleasures of life as the world unfolds in vibrancy before you.",
