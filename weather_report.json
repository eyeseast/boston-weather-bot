    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Boston, gray clouds mingle uncertainly with the fading light, offering a hint of the moisture that lingers in the air. Tonight's forecast brings a slight chance of showers and the risk of distant thunderstorms waning as the hour grows late. With temperatures gently resting around 64, the tendrils of wind, light yet perceptible, evoke feelings of a summer evening that\u2019s still holding onto the promise of warmth even as the coolness sets in. The air carries a crisp clarity, giving residents that delightful combination of energy and calm that evenings often bring.\n\nLooking toward Independence Day, the horizon suggests brighter possibilities, as tomorrow's forecast reveals sunny skies gracing the day with warmth\u2014a high around 82, and a gentle northwesterly breeze to accompany picnics and celebrations. This pleasant turn invites you to layer lightly; a t-shirt beneath a light jacket should suffice for the evening chill, while daylight calls for casual attire and perhaps that favorite pair of sunglasses to appreciate the vibrant hues of fireworks that will soon illuminate the night sky. Embrace the unexpected delights of the evening: a leisurely stroll by the Charles, savoring a quiet moment with a book at a local cafe, or sharing light conversation over a cup of coffee.",
