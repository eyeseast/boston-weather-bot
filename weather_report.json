    "weather_report": "In Boston, the sky wraps the city in a thick, gray embrace, casting a somber palette across the afternoon. A whispered promise of rain hangs in the air, punctuated by fleeting moments of drizzle. Despite the clouds cloaking the sun, the temperature hovers around a cool 59 degrees, inviting the breezes to play. As the east wind stirs softly, it carries with it the scent of impending moisture, a gentle reminder that nature is about to turn. Fog lurks in the corners, mulling over the streets as the day eases toward twilight.\n\nAs night descends, the scene transforms into one of hushed anticipation, with rain showers likely to greet Bostonians shortly. A low temperature of around 52 invites an extra layer; a light jacket or sweater would shield against the chill while still allowing for comfortable movement. Umbrellas will soon become a familiar sight as showers mingle with patches of fog, painting the landscape in mystical shades of dimness. Given the murky conditions and persistent precipitation, a cozy evening indoors may serve as the perfect retreat. One might consider curling up with a book or indulging in that film you've been meaning to watch, sipping a warm beverage while the world outside blurs and softens under the rain's rhythm.",
