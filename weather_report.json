    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Boston, a gentle obscurity lingers in the air, suggesting a day that will dance between sunlit brilliance and unexpected storms. The morning greets you with a hazy warmth, promising a high that flirts with 87 degrees. Yet, as the sun begins its climb, the temperature will mellow into a comfortable embrace of around 81, guided by a spirited southwest breeze that will occasionally playfully gust through the streets, hinting at the vitality of the day ahead.\n\nWith isolated showers and thunderstorms rolling in later, it would be wise to don layers, perhaps a light shirt under a smooth jacket that can guard against unexpected bursts of rainfall. Those wandering along the river or savoring a coffee in the park should remain alert, as the afternoon\u2019s ambiance shifts, shrouded in the possibility of a thunderous serenade. As evening descends, expect a more robust downpour and perhaps a hint of drama, as the skies coordinate their efforts for a symphonic display of nature\u2019s vigor. Do keep an umbrella handy if you venture out later, but consider seizing the moment now to enjoy the brisk energy of the morning\u2014perhaps a stroll through the cobblestone streets, inviting the essence of Boston to weave itself into your thoughts. Listen closely, and you may hear whispers of both potential joy and the thrill of the impending storms.",
