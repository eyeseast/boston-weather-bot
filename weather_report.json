    "weather_report": "As dawn gives way to the day, Boston awakens under a gentle embrace of parting clouds, the sun casting a warm glow that promises a delightful afternoon. With temperatures poised to reach a comfortable 78 degrees, the breeze whispers softly from the southwest, urging you to step outside and savor the unfolding moments. For those wandering the city's streets or perhaps strolling along the Charles River, the air is fresh, invigorating, urging a light jacket or perhaps a crisp linen shirt as the perfect attire for this pleasantly mild spring day.\n\nBut not all is set to remain serene: as the clock inches toward the late hours, clouds will gather in anticipation of rain. A chance of showers lurks after the clock strikes two, a gentle reminder of nature's unpredictability. As twilight approaches, the temperatures will dip softly to around 56 degrees, inviting you to consider a cozy moment indoors or an early evening gathering with friends over a warm cup at a local caf\u00e9. Whether you choose to bask in the sun's glow now or prepare for the slumbering storm ahead, today in Boston offers the promise of tranquil beauty mixed with the thrill of a fleeting summer rain.",
