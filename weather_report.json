    "weather_report": "As the dawn unfurls over Boston, a tapestry of muted grays envelops the city, with patchy fog clinging to the rooftops and streets still damp from last night\u2019s rains. A lingering heaviness in the air suggests that showers and thunderstorms are likely to hang around for just a little while longer, possibly before yielding to a shy sun that may break free as the day progresses. The atmosphere feels charged with anticipation, a reminder that nature often sways between the gentleness of a summer day and the sudden ferocity of storms. As the clock ticks by, the promise of partly sunny skies seems to lean on the horizon, beckoning those willing to seek a respite from the damp.\n\nWith temperatures reaching into the comfortable embrace of the seventies by midday, the chill of the morning seems destined to melt away, inviting Bostonians outside. A light jacket or a hoodie, perhaps paired with breathable pants, would suit the mood and the weather well\u2014with just enough room for layers in case the winds stir up again. If you're inclined to stroll, consider the charm of local cafes or the quietude of the parks where you might find a moment to savor a warm drink. As the hours progress toward evening and the air cools to a more laid-back tempo, the evening invites a comfortable gathering indoors or a stroll along the shore, letting the gentle whispers of the breeze weave stories against your skin.",
