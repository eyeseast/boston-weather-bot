    "weather_report": "As the quiet hours of the night settle over Boston, a soft chill contours the atmosphere, resting somewhere around 21 degrees. The sky wears a gentle veil of partly cloudy fabric, suggesting a stillness that prevails as the city sleeps. Tomorrow promises the warmth of sunshine, heralding a promising transition with highs reaching toward 31 before sliding back to a cool 25 as afternoon approaches. The west winds, though placid now, will stir into a lively dance, gusting with intent and character, a harbinger of brisk and invigorating moments throughout the day.\n\nUpon awakening, one may find it prudent to dress warmly\u2014a layer of knit sweaters, perhaps paired with a timeless scarf or a wool-capped hat to ward off the brisk touch of winter. The clarity of the day will invite you outdoors, so consider a casual stroll along the Charles, where the whisper of the wind mingles with the serene lapping of water against the bank. Alternatively, the brisk air could perfectly complement a visit to one of Boston\u2019s quaint cafes, allowing the warmth of a well-brewed coffee to cradle your hands. The city, crisp and vibrant in its winter attire, awaits your footsteps.",
