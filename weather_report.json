    "weather_report": "This afternoon unfolds in Boston under a beautiful blanket of mostly sunny skies, the sun casting a warm embrace over the city\u2019s more muted hues. With gentle winds brushing through at a pleasing direction, the atmosphere is invigorating, inviting those with an appreciation for crisp air to step outside. As evening approaches, the clarity that characterizes the day will give way to a tranquil night, where the stars may twinkle through the partly cloudy canvas.\n\nTo navigate this delightful day comfortably, a light jacket or a cozy cardigan is wise, perfect for the chill that will settle as darkness creeps in. Consider meandering through the city\u2019s storied neighborhoods, perhaps indulging in the charm of a neighborhood caf\u00e9 or exploring the gentle rhythms of the park\u2014moments marked by the simple pleasures of spring in New England. As the low humidity keeps the air feeling refreshing, you might even glimpse the faint outlines of distant hills, an invitation to let your thoughts wander as freely as the soothing winds.",
