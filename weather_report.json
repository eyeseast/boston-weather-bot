    "weather_report": "In Boston, a sullen curtain of rain envelops the morning, the sky draped in heavy gray clouds that promise a day of dampness and chill. The air is thick with moisture, each droplet painting the world in muted shades, obscuring the familiar sights of the city. It feels as though nature has wrapped itself in a heavy blanket, making even the most vibrant streets seem subdued. With temperatures hovering around a cool 60 degrees, the wind whispers softly from the southwest, but it\u2019s a voice that carries the damp chill of impending rain, inviting you to seek warmth and shelter.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the rain to linger, with only a faint glimmer of hope for its reprieve before dawn transitions into a brisk evening. With temperatures dropping to the low 30s, it would be wise to dress warmly\u2014perhaps layering a cozy sweater beneath a waterproof jacket, complemented by sturdy shoes to keep the elements at bay. This weather calls for indoor pursuits; consider a stroll through the quiet aisles of a local bookstore, where the soft rustle of pages turns into an inviting symphony. Coupled with a warm cup of coffee, the day\u2019s melancholy might transform into a comforting retreat. Alternatively, a leisurely visit to a nearby art gallery allows the heart to embrace creativity and the spirit to escape the dreary weather outside.",
