    "weather_report": "As the night envelops Boston, a gentle symphony of snow showers begins to weave its way through the fabric of the city\u2019s slumber. The air is crisp, punctuated by a chill that invites you to bundle up in layers, perhaps donning a woolen scarf and a snug hat to brace against the whispers of winter. Expect the early hours to yield new snow, a soft frosting that might dapple the landscapes with a fresh glint, though this beauty may be accompanied by a pervasive cloudiness that cloaks the stars.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the city will shed its nocturnal quietude for a day that dances between light and shadow. The morning may tease a few fleeting flurries before giving way to the promise of rain. Despite the potential for precipitation, this Wednesday hints at fleeting moments of sunshine, inviting you to wander through the brisk air in a comfortable coat, avoiding the temptation to skip the umbrella. With gusts brushing by, one might find joy in an afternoon stroll along the Charles or perhaps a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9, where the warmth and aroma of freshly brewed coffee can soothe the soul against the remnants of winter\u2019s chill.",
