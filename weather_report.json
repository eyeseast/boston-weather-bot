    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of the night, Boston rests beneath a blanket of stillness, the air crisp with a whisper of frost that foretells the day ahead. The temperature dips close to freezing, inviting a chill that wraps around the city like an old friend. As dawn approaches, a promise of transformation hovers in the atmosphere. The forecast suggests that as the afternoon unfolds, soft rains will make their entrance, accompanied by a gentle northeast breeze that rustles through the remnants of autumn\u2019s foliage. \n\nWhile the morning may begin with the faintest glimmers of sunlight, those venturing out will want to dress warmly\u2014perhaps a knitted scarf and a sturdy jacket will do, to fend off the biting chill. As the day progresses and clouds gather, the prospect of rain looms with an 80% chance of dampness. Nevertheless, the impending precipitation shouldn't deter the spirit; a stroll through one of Boston\u2019s historic neighborhoods, sheltering under an umbrella, could be a serene escape. The reflections of raindrops on cobblestones and the muted sounds of the city provide an intimate tapestry of urban life in winter.",
