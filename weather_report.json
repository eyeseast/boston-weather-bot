    "weather_report": "As the clock inches toward the dawn of a fresh Thursday in Boston, the night whispers cool secrets of the approaching day. With temperatures resting around a crisp forty-one degrees, the air carries a refreshing chill, as a gentle northwest breeze weaves its way through the cityscape. Stars may be retreating, surrendering to the blue-hued light on the horizon, leaving behind a tranquil stillness, unmarred by fog or haze.\n\nThe sun will soon stretch its rays across the skyline, heralding a mostly sunny and invigorating day. However, do not be fooled by its initial warmth; expect temperatures to taper off in the afternoon. The Northwest wind, with a hint of briskness, may leave you feeling a touch cooler than anticipated, nudging you to wrap a cozy scarf around your neck or slip on a warm sweater as you step outside. This day invites a stroll down the Charles River Esplanade or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s parks, where nature holds the promise of autumnal beauty. As day unfolds, chosen activities might drift towards enjoying a warm cup of coffee in your favorite caf\u00e9, or perhaps diving into a good book in the comforting embrace of soft sunlight and shadows.",
