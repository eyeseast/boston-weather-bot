    "weather_report": "This afternoon, Boston basks under a canopy of soft sunlight, promising a delightful escape into the outdoors. The air feels fresh, with a gentle southeast breeze ruffling through the trees and mingling with the scent of early blooms. As the high flirts with 70 degrees, it invites leisurely strolls along the harbor or perhaps a visit to the neighborhood park, where the sun-kissed grass quietly beckons. Yet, as the day tiptoes toward evening, a hint of change lingers on the horizon. The clouds, eager to weave their blanket of gray, may bring a dance of light rain and some patchy fog after midnight. \n\nAs twilight approaches, the temperatures cool to around 58 degrees. It would be prudent to layer up with a light jacket, just in case the evening chill settles in. The unpredictability of the night suggests that leisurely indoor pursuits might be best\u2014perhaps a cozy evening at your favorite caf\u00e9, a quiet read by the window, or an exploration of Boston\u2019s vibrant restaurant scene. The chance for rain adds a pleasant suspense to the evening, as it can transform the city streets into a canvas shimmering under city lights.",
