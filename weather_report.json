    "weather_report": "As the clock nears the midnight hour in Boston, the air carries the weight of a persistent rain, gently draping the streets with shimmering reflections. The clouds hang low, cloaking the city in a damp embrace, hinting at the chill that gnaws at the edges of warmth despite the hustle of day. Tonight, the temperature lingers around a brisk 39 degrees, with the north wind whispering through the alleyways, occasionally stirring up a stronger gust that challenges pedestrians with its bite. \n\nTomorrow graces us with the promise of continued rain, interspersed with the possibility of fog that may cling to the corners of the city. The high will barely reach 46, a reminder to don layers\u2014perhaps a sturdy waterproof jacket with a cozy scarf to wrap around your neck. Footwear should be practical, meant for puddles rather than promenades. These conditions encourage embracing the indoor warmth of a beloved caf\u00e9 or library, where one might find solace in a good book or conversation, all while the world outside is brushed with a veil of rain and scattered fog. The charm of a quiet afternoon spent sipping tea or coffee, with the sound of raindrops tapping against the window, becomes a comforting alternative to venturing into the elements.",
