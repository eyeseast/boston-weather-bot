    "weather_report": "As the night drapes itself over Boston, a tranquility settles in, mingling with the faint glow of city lights that punctuate the dark canvas. The air feels crisp, carrying the promise of a clear morning. Those brave enough to step outside are met with a refreshing chill, a prelude to the sun\u2019s anticipated ascent. Overnight temperatures hover around a modest 17 degrees, with a gentle breeze weaving through the streets, whispering tales of the coolness to come.\n\nDawn will break with an invitation to the sun; a bright and mostly sunny day awaits those who venture out. With a high nearing 24 degrees, pleasant warmth cascades in, although brisk winds may flirt at peak gusts of 22 mph. This is not a day for heavy winter attire; instead, opt for light layers that provide warmth against the chill, yet allow for movement as the sun encourages a touch of spring-like spirit. Perhaps meander through the charming streets of Beacon Hill, the soft crunch of frost beneath your boots grounding you in the moment, or settle into one of the cozy cafes that dot the landscape, sipping a warm drink while watching the urban tableau unfold. It\u2019s a day to appreciate Boston's character, a pleasing balance of chilly and sunny, inviting discovery in every corner of the bustling metropolis.",
