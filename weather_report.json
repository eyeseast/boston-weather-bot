    "weather_report": "Boston greets the day with a gentle embrace of clouds, a soft veil draped over the skyline. The air carries a slight chill, hinting at the high temperature that hovers near 54, while a northeast wind plays lightly, whispering through the streets with just enough vigor to inspire a jacket or sweater. This morning's muted light filters through the clouds, casting a serene, if subdued, palette over the city, inviting introspection rather than frenzied activity.\n\nAs twilight beckons, clouds will thicken, merging seamlessly with the hint of rain that may arrive just after dawn breaks. The evening promises a low around 47, and while there\u2019s a mere whisper of a chance at precipitation, the day maintains a quiet tension, a reminder of the shifting seasons. Given this ambiance, one might find solace in a leisurely stroll through a local park, perhaps savoring a warm beverage from a nearby caf\u00e9. A visit to the Boston Public Library, with its warm interiors, could offer a perfect refuge, allowing for quiet reading or reflection as the rain teases the windowpanes. In this slightly dreary but certainly cozy scene, opt for layers\u2014light enough for the brief moments of freshness, yet warm enough for the embrace of that fleeting evening chill.",
