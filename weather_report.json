    "weather_report": "As the tranquil night drapes itself over Boston, a faint whisper of snow dances on the horizon, teasing the landscape with the promise of deeper winter. The air carries a crisp chill, inviting a touch of warmth from a well-worn coat and cozy scarf. Those venturing out might find the streets bathed in the soft glow of streetlights, a serene quiet punctuated only by the whispering wind. While the chance of snow lingers before dawn, the temperature is expected to rise marginally, teasing the threshold of 32 degrees as the clock ticks into the early hours.\n\nCome Wednesday, the skies will shift, giving way to the likelihood of rain after the sun's ascent. The day will unfold under a cloak of clouds, with a high that flirts with 47 degrees. Winds will make their presence known, whispering through the trees and perhaps urging a few twigs to dance in slow circles. It\u2019s a day for thoughtful layers: a sturdy umbrella could become your steadfast companion amidst the drizzling skies. While the rain may keep many indoors, don\u2019t let it dampen your spirit; perhaps today is an opportunity to savor the smell of freshly brewed coffee at a local caf\u00e9, or to lose yourself in the pages of a book at a nearby library, where soft murmurs and the rustling of pages create a comforting symphony.",
