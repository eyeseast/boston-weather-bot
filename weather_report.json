    "weather_report": "As midnight unfurls across the quiet city of Boston, a crisp clarity blankets the landscape, with the temperature settling gently around 35 degrees. A soft west wind whispers through the streets, stirring an early promise of a calm and inviting day ahead. The moonlight casts a serene glow on the urban panorama, hinting at the warmth that will soon beckon as dawn breaks.\n\nOn Saturday, the skies will awaken with a brilliant sun, coaxing the temperature to rise toward a pleasant 59 degrees. The southwest wind, playful and determined, will whip through the trees and across the Common, perhaps gusting boldly to remind us that spring is in its tentative grasp yet still followed by the cool breath of winter. It\u2019s a day that invites exploration, making it ideal for a leisurely stroll through the historic streets, where the vibrant hues of the city come alive under the radiance of sunlight. Those venturing outside should dress in layers\u2014perhaps a lightweight sweater over a shirt, accompanied by comfortable jeans and a light scarf to ward off the chill in the early hours. As the day unfolds, the cheerful brightness will reveal itself to be a beautiful backdrop for an afternoon spent in the parks, perhaps on a bench with a good book or sharing conversation with a friend.",
