    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the city and its surroundings. With temperatures hovering pleasantly around 85 degrees, the air feels inviting and light, brushed by a gentle southward breeze. The bright cerulean sky is punctuated by fluffy white clouds, offering a perfect backdrop for the vibrant hustle and bustle below. As evening approaches, expect a soft transition into partly cloudy skies, with the temperature dipping to a cozy 69 degrees, hinting at a warm, comforting night ahead.\n\nIt\u2019s a splendid afternoon to indulge in the simple pleasures of summer. A stroll along the Esplanade would do wonders, where the rhythmic lapping of the Charles River matches the pace of lazy conversations. Perhaps a visit to an outdoor caf\u00e9, enjoying a light salad or a refreshing iced tea, would be the ultimate picturesque respite. Dress in cotton and linen; breathable fabrics will embrace the summery warmth while allowing a sigh of relief as you explore Boston's corners. As the sun begins its descent, finding a lovely spot to settle in with a good book could not only round off the day but also enrich your evening with tranquility.",
