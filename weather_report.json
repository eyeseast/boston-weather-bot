    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, a soft shroud of clouds envelops the city, subtly hinting at the possibility of rain showers that may drift in after 1 PM. The air is invigorated by a brisk southwest wind, lending a spirited coolness to the high that hovers around 67 degrees. However, there is an aromatic promise of rain lurking, as the clouds thicken and the atmosphere thickens with an impending chance of thunderstorms later tonight. With temperatures expected to dip into the mid-forties, rising slightly overnight, the evening will likely find many seeking shelter under cozy layers as moisture gathers in the air.\n\nGiven these conditions, those venturing out should dress warmly in layers, complementing their attire with waterproof elements to combat the gathering storms. As the skies darken and rain begins to tap softly on rooftops, perhaps it is an ideal time to lose oneself in a cozy caf\u00e9 with a well-worn book, letting the world outside fade into the gentle sound of rain. Alternatively, for those feeling adventurous, a brisk walk under the shadows of historic architecture could invigorate the spirit before the real downpour settles in. Embrace the day\u2019s nuance, for even in the gathering clouds, there lies a serene beauty.",
