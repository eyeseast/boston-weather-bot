    "weather_report": "As the dusk settles over Boston, a shroud of mostly cloudy skies blankets the city, draping a calm yet chilly atmosphere. The temperature gently nudges down towards the low twenties, inviting a stillness that wraps around evening strolls or quiet moments with a warm beverage in hand. The winds, subtle and almost whisper-like, drift softly from the west, encouraging one to pull an extra layer closer for comfort.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, a promise of clarity emerges; the sun will rise to cast a bright and hopeful glow across the city, as warmer temperatures reach for the mid-forties. This serene transition beckons activity, with thoughts of wandering through a nearby park or paying a visit to a favorite caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh pastries pairs beautifully with the day\u2019s newfound warmth. Given the crispness of the evening and the brightness of the anticipated day, dressing in layers is advisable, combining both warmth and versatility\u2014an inviting scarf and a comfortable coat will serve you well as you navigate the ebb and flow of urban life.",
