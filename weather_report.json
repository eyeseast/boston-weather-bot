    "weather_report": "As twilight descends over Boston, the sky wears a cloak of partly cloudy gray, casting a tranquil yet brisk ambiance across the city. With the temperature hovering around a chilly 21 degrees, the west wind whispers through the streets, creating a gentle yet invigorating chill that beckons for a snug scarf and gloves. The lights of Boston twinkle against the night, each one a reminder of the warmth that awaits within cozy caf\u00e9s or bustling restaurants, where the aroma of hot beverages dances in the chilly air.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, a sunlit promise lingers in the atmosphere. With a high near a pleasing 32 degrees, the day should unfold under a bright, open sky, inviting residents and visitors to embrace the outdoors. Layered attire will serve well for the morning\u2019s coolness, but by afternoon, a simple sweater might suffice as nature gifts the city with its golden rays. A stroll through the city's scenic parks, a leisurely visit to the local markets, or perhaps a moment spent reading on a sun-drenched bench could make for charming Saturday pursuits, reminding everyone that even in winter, Boston holds a special kind of warmth.",
