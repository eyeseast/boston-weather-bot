    "weather_report": "A brisk aura envelopes Boston this afternoon, as the sun peeks through shifting clouds, teasing the chilly air with hints of warmth. The temperature hovers around a modest 49 degrees, accompanied by a determined northwest wind that whips through the streets, stirring the leaves and prompting a brisk walk beneath the dramatic sky. Gusts, bold and fleeting, dance across the city with peaks that challenge both umbrella and hat. As daylight eases into evening, expect a gentle descent into clarity, where the low dips to around 35, illuminated by the fading light and a sparse constellation of stars that will emerge once the sun submits to darkness.\n\nFor those venturing outdoors, a layered approach to dressing is advisable; a warm jacket paired with a comfortable sweater and sturdy footwear creates an ensemble fitting for a stroll along the waterfront or a quiet moment at one of the city's charming cafes. This sort of day invites leisurely pursuits\u2014perhaps a visit to a local bookstore to embrace the latest literary treasures, or a quiet retreat to a park where one can savor a hot beverage and delight in the crispness of late winter\u2019s retreat. Such moments flourish beneath the sky\u2019s ever-changing canvas, painting life with shades of possibility.",
