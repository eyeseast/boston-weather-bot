    "weather_report": "As night drapes its silken folds over Boston, the city breathes a collective sigh of calm, punctuated by distant lights twinkling like stars in a void of deep velvet. The air carries a crispness that hints at the chill of the approaching dawn, a time when shadows lengthen and the promise of a new day begins. With temperatures settling into the low teens, one may find solace in wrapping themselves warmly, perhaps in a thick sweater and a cozy scarf, a nod to the enveloping cold that night brings. \n\nTomorrow, the sun will make a tentative appearance, though clouds will tease its brightness with the possibility of snow curling in just after dusk. An afternoon high will flirt with the high twenties, offering a brief moment of respite before the chill returns. One might stroll through the whispering streets adorned with a fresh layer of powder, the perfect backdrop for spirited conversations or quiet contemplation. It will be a day to embrace the beauty of winter\u2019s stillness, the kind that invites one to sip hot beverages, visit cherished local caf\u00e9s, or simply wander through a nearby park wrapped in warmth and wonder as the world shifts into its soft, frosted embrace.",
