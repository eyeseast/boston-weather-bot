    "weather_report": "As night blankets Boston, the city is adorned in twinkling lights, a comforting contrast against the chill in the air. The sky sits mostly clear, allowing starlight to seep through the dark canvas, though temperatures dip to a brisk low of 34 degrees. A gentle west wind whispers through the streets, inviting those who venture outdoors to bundle up in warm layers, perhaps a cozy scarf and a snug overcoat to combat the night\u2019s bite.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the promise of bright sunshine beckons, though rain clouds may gather in the afternoon. With a high projected near 47 degrees, Wednesday offers a mix of hope and unpredictability\u2014perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River in the morning warmth or a visit to one of the city\u2019s fine caf\u00e9s, where the aroma of fresh coffee mingles with the soft chatter of the day. However, do keep an eye on the sky as the afternoon approaches; a chance of light rain looms, so carrying an umbrella might be wise. For today, enjoy the calm of the evening with a book or a comforting cup of tea, leaving the more adventurous spirits to ponder the weather's capriciousness.",
