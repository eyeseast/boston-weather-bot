    "weather_report": "As dawn gently approaches Boston, the mist clings to the buildings and streets, veiling them in a cloak of patchy fog. The air is cool, with whispers of a north wind stirring softly, hinting at a transition towards a brighter day ahead. This fog, while a touch disorienting, offers a serene moment to watch the city come alive in muted colors, with the distant glow of lights barely piercing through the haze.\n\nAs the sun rises higher in the sky, the forecast promises a shift. Expect the fog to dissipate and yield to a canvas of partly sunny skies, with those welcoming rays nudging the temperature towards a pleasant warmth. It will be a day to embrace the outdoors without the encumbrance of heavy layers\u2014light jackets or sweaters will suffice, offering comfort against any lingering coolness from the morning. Ideal activities might include a meandering stroll along the Charles River, coffee in hand, or perhaps a leisurely visit to a local bookstore, savoring the quiet before the bustle of day unfolds. In this transitional moment, there lies an invitation to enjoy the simple pleasures, to breathe in the freshness of the air, and to marvel at the beauty that a new day brings.",
