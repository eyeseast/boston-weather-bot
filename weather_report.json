    "weather_report": "As the night clings to Boston, a quiet anticipation lingers in the air, foreshadowing the rain-soaked day ahead. Current conditions offer a hint of chill, with temperatures drifting down to around 32 degrees, encouraging cozy layers and perhaps a steaming cup of something warm. As dawn approaches, the promise of vibrant rain showers emerges, set to commence around the gentle stirrings of morning. By daybreak, the sky will bear a heavy shroud of clouds, releasing rain and leaving the air thick with a patchy fog that might blur the edges of the familiar skyline.\n\nThis Tuesday, Boston will be wrapped in a damp embrace, making it a day best suited for those who find comfort in the indoors. With the temperatures hovering around the brisk mid-50s, it may be wise to don a waterproof jacket, perhaps paired with sturdy shoes, to navigate the wet streets with ease. Should you find the spirit to venture out, consider visiting a local caf\u00e9 to enjoy a moment of quiet nestled away from the rain, or perhaps indulge in a leisurely stroll through an art gallery, where the colors inside stand vibrant against the muted tones of the outside. While it may not present as the sunniest of days, there is a certain charm to the coziness found on a drizzly afternoon.",
