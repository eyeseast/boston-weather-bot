    "weather_report": "As tonight envelops Boston, a gentle fog begins to weave its way through the calm streets, softening the outlines of the skyline and creating an ethereal haze that cloaks the city in mystery. The temperatures settle comfortably around 54 degrees, with a whisper of an eastward breeze to carry the lingering warmth of the day into the evening. Those stepping outside may find themselves reaching for a light jacket, feeling the cool air mix with the subtle humidity that hints at the fog\u2019s persistence.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the fog will lift early, making way for a canvas of blue sky and an inviting warmth as the sun climbs higher, promising a delightful high of nearly 72 degrees. The northeast breeze will play softly through the trees, providing that refreshing touch that invites one to linger outdoors. With such splendid conditions on the horizon, it\u2019s an ideal day for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River, perhaps sipping a warm coffee from a local caf\u00e9, or a quiet visit to the Public Garden, where the colors of early autumn begin to unfurl. Dress comfortably, in layers to embrace the transition from morning\u2019s cool embrace to the afternoon\u2019s gentle warmth, and allow the day to unfold with a sense of simple enjoyment.",
