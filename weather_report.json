    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks toward dawn in Boston, a gentle, promising patter of rain signals the arrival of overnight showers. The thick blanket of clouds above casts a muted and serene glow over the city, offering a touch of quiet mystery to the vibrant urban landscape. The air carries a coolness, hovering around the mid-fifties, tempered by a soft southern breeze. As dawn breaks, expect patches of fog to weave through the streets, lending an ethereal touch to the familiar environment.\n\nThursday appears to unfold in a similar, grayed palette, with an anticipated high that grants just a whisper of warmth, lingering near sixty-four. The rain is expected to persist intermittently throughout the day, reflecting the somber yet comforting rhythm of nature. For those venturing out, layering becomes paramount\u2014a light, waterproof jacket paired with comfortable shoes suitable for splashing through puddles will serve both utility and style. Activities of the day may call for a leisurely stroll through local cafes, where hours can be spent admiring the steamy dance of coffee and conversation. Alternatively, consider seeking refuge in artful galleries or cozy libraries, allowing the rhythms of the outside world to play out from a place of warmth and contemplation.",
