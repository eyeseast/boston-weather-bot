    "weather_report": "As twilight drapes itself over Boston, the air carries a gentle clarity, softened by the wispy clouds that roam languidly across the sky. With the temperature whispering around fifty-one degrees, a light breeze brings a refreshing touch, inviting a moment of reflection as evening settles in. Tonight, you can expect it to remain partly cloudy, a comforting canvas painted by the fading light. Those stepping outside might find a light jacket a companionable choice, as the evening air cools and the golden hues of sunset yield to the deepening blue.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, Boston promises to wake to a radiant embrace as the sun bursts forth, heralding a high near seventy-eight degrees. With a gentle north wind caressing the city, it could be the perfect day for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River or to explore the cobblestone streets of Beacon Hill. As the warmth envelops the day, anything from savoring an outdoor caf\u00e9 experience to visiting the verdant expanses of the Public Garden could unveil delightful pleasures. The weather holds the promise of a sweet, sun-kissed day amidst the booming vibrancy of the city.",
