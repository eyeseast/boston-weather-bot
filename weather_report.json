    "weather_report": "As twilight deepens over Boston, the evening is draped in a veil of clouds, hinting at the gentle embrace of moisture hanging in the air. A slight chance of rain showers lingers through the night, tapering off with only whispers of fog pending. The low temperature wraps around 63 degrees, inviting comfort but also a touch of caution for those stepping outdoors. The whispers of a south wind, steady at eight to twelve miles per hour, promise a soft caress but carry the potential for swells in gusts that may surprise you. \n\nLooking toward tomorrow, the dawn will greet us with patchy fog that should dissipate by mid-morning, giving way to a partly sunny sky that hints at a high near 84. There is warmth in that forecast, a beckoning toward lazy strolls and coffee on the porch. As the sun takes its rightful place in the sky, it might be wise to dress in layers, opting for comfortable attire that can adapt to the gentle stretch of the day. Perhaps venture out to a local caf\u00e9, or take a walk along the Esplanade where the sparkle of the Charles offers a refreshing perspective, warming the spirit as the city stirs.",
