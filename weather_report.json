    "weather_report": "Morning graces Boston with a promise of a splendid spring day. Currently kissed by soft sunlight, the city awakens beneath a sky of serene azure, adorned with a few fluffy clouds that seem content to drift lazily by. The air carries a pleasant freshness, hinting at the gentle eastward breeze that stirs with a whisper, urging you to step outside and savor the moment. The temperature dances close to a delightful warmth, coaxing us to shed heavier layers and embrace lighter attire that still offers a gentle shield against the coolness lingering from night.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the sun to shine brighter, illuminating the streets with a soft glow and drawing people outdoors. A stroll through the Public Garden, perhaps, would be well-suited to such a day, where blooming flowers provide splashes of color amidst lush greenery. For those who find joy in quieter moments, a cozy caf\u00e9 with an inviting outdoor seating area would offer a perfect respite to sip on a warm beverage and watch the city animate around you. As the evening approaches, the sky will collect hints of evening\u2019s blush, and it's wise to keep a light jacket at hand, considering the temperature will dip gently, inviting a calm end to a fulfilling day.",
