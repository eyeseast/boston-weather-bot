    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks across the Boston skyline, an ephemeral fog lingers like a whisper, soon to yield to light as the sun stretches its golden limbs across the city. The atmosphere is a gentle embrace, with the promise of a partly sunny day ahead. While the air holds a coolness that hints at the remnants of night, that soothing warmth will soon rise, inviting you to venture outside. With temperatures expected to hover near 83, a simple yet comfortable ensemble\u2014a light shirt for the day and perhaps a light sweater for the evening's embrace\u2014will serve well against the gentle breeze that sweeps in from the east.\n\nGiven this inviting forecast, it\u2019s a splendid day for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River, where the water glimmers like shattered glass under the sun's approval. Alternatively, seeking refuge in one of Boston\u2019s many charming cafes could offer both warmth and the opportunity to sample a steaming cup of coffee with a warm pastry as you watch the city awaken. The evening will wrap the city in a soft blanket of clouds, with patchy fog returning, but for now, let the day unfold with the promise of pleasant experiences waiting to be had.",
