    "weather_report": "As afternoon settles softly over Boston, the city wears a cloak of muted clouds, a subtle dance of gray brushing against a canvas of pale blue. With temperatures hovering around a gentle 66 degrees, the air feels pleasantly crisp, invigorating the spirit while calling for a light jacket or a cozy sweater, ideal companions for a stroll down the esplanade or a quiet moment spent in one of the city\u2019s parks. The southeast wind, a mere whisper at 6 mph, carries with it the faintest invitation to unwind, breathe deeply, and embrace the solace of a leisurely day.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the clouds will linger, embracing the city in their gentle grasp, with a low dipping into the comfort of 52 degrees tonight. To mark this evening, consider gathering with friends over tea or sharing stories in the warm glow of a well-loved caf\u00e9. There\u2019s a charm in the mildness, an appeal in the clouds that suggest warmth rather than isolation. Thus, Boston is set for a day that invites both introspection and light-hearted companionship, a day to lace up comfortable shoes and wander without haste, discovering the warmth of the community between the folds of silky clouds.",
