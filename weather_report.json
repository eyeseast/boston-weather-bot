    "weather_report": "As the day softly wanes in Boston, a curtain of clouds envelops the skyline, dimming the light that dances off buildings and streets. The air carries a cool chill, with temperatures dipping to a modest 46 degrees, a reminder of the lingering spring. While the evening offers a slight chance of rain, it remains merely a whisper in the breeze\u2014just enough to warrant a light jacket as you venture outside. The northeast wind teases the senses, a gentle companion that encourages you to wrap yourself in warmth as the last rays of sunlight retreat.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the clouds will remain, cloaking the city in a blanket of gray. The possibility of rain lingers in the air, more an expectation than a certainty, inviting thoughts of cozy pursuits. Whether it's time spent leafing through a favorite book at a quaint caf\u00e9 or indulging in the simple pleasure of a long walk wrapped in layers, today's atmosphere propels you toward comfort. Dress in layers to adapt to the chilly temperament of the day, perhaps a soft scarf or a warm beanie to ward off the evening chill. Embrace the subtle beauty of a cloudy day, letting it guide you to find your own quiet moments amidst the bustling streets of this storied city.",
