    "weather_report": "In this afternoon light, Boston greets us with a gentle embrace of pastel hues, as the sun drifts among scattered clouds and offers a momentary warmth against the chill. With temperatures hovering around 38 degrees, the air carries a crispness that hints at the evening to come. You may notice the subtle shift in the atmosphere, a whisper of potential snow looming with the clouds thickening into a moody gray as night approaches. The wind, a soft southwest breath, is inviting but carries the promise of colder air edging in soon.\n\nAs dusk settles, a chance of snowflakes may dance down after 11 PM, lightly brushing the city\u2019s rooftops and encouraging a tranquil ambiance. Tonight's forecast suggests a low in the upper 20s, and while the chill may urge you to retreat indoors, donning your coziest layers\u2014perhaps a snug scarf and hat\u2014will allow for an evening stroll, savoring the quiet streets adorned with their early winter charm. Rather than seeking out overly ambitious adventures, imagine a quiet coffee shop where you can savor a warm drink and gaze out at the gently falling snow, nestled comfortably against the backdrop of a friendly city winding down the day.",
