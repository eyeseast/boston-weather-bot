    "weather_report": "In the early hours of Friday, Boston awakens gently shrouded in a veil of patchy fog, the world around us a muted palette of grays. The air carries a coolness, settling in around fifty degrees, hinting at the quiet chill that sits just beneath the surface. While the fog may seem disorienting at first, there is a calm intrigue in this diminished visibility, where outlines of the familiar become soft and mysterious. As the morning unfolds, this misty curtain will give way to scattered rain showers, intertwining with the fog in a delicate dance, making for a gray and overcast day. The gentle, persistent whispers of a northeast wind will keep the air brisk and invigorating, coaxing those who venture out to bundle up a little. \n\nAs the day progresses, it would be wise to reach for a cozy sweater and perhaps a light waterproof jacket, embracing the practicality of layers. The allure of a caf\u00e9 calls, with the promise of warmth and the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee inviting all to seek refuge from the dampness. An easy stroll through the hushed streets, while dodging the occasional shower, could unearth the quiet beauty of the city hidden beneath the clouds. This day may not hold the sun's brilliance, but it holds the charm of a cozy urban retreat, where gentle rain creates a rhythm that invites us to slow down and appreciate the simple pleasures that weave through our daily lives.",
