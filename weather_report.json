    "weather_report": "The air over Boston carries a crisp chill this M.L. King Jr. Day, as the clouds drift lazily through the sky, allowing fleeting glimpses of sunlit moments to break through. A tranquil, yet invigorating southwest wind brushes against the city, offering a gentle reminder of winter\u2019s embrace, while the temperature hovers near a cool 35 degrees, inviting both those bold and those bundled in layers to venture outside. As evening approaches, the clouds will grow thicker, ushering in a partly cloudy night with temperatures dipping to a brisk 16. The gusty winds, at times, will remind you of their presence, rustling branches and whispering through quiet streets.\n\nIn light of these conditions, I suggest donning a warm coat, complemented with a scarf and gloves, as the winds can nip at exposed skin. The gray sky, dotted with patches of blue, pairs beautifully with the soft blanket of snow that adorns the city, making it an ideal backdrop for a leisurely stroll or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9. The ambiance carries a sense of peace, perfect for reflecting on the day or catching up with friends over warm cups of coffee. Whether you choose to explore the scenic parks or indulge in a bit of indoor leisure reading, seize the day before the cloister of night envelops all in its embrace.",
