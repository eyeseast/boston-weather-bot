    "weather_report": "As night falls over Boston, the city is cloaked in a gentle shroud of clouds, offering a serene but somewhat muted ambiance. The air, brisk yet invigorating, brushes against the skin with a chill that speaks of the approaching winter. Tonight, temperatures dip into the low thirties, and the west wind whispers through the streets, at times raising its voice in gusts that dance around 29 miles per hour. It\u2019s an evening best spent in the warmth of layered clothing, perhaps a well-worn scarf and a cozy coat, equipped to fend off the crispness of the night.\n\nTomorrow brings a breath of potential as daylight breaks, with a slight chance of snow teasing the early hours, giving way to the possibility of rain as the afternoon approaches. The anticipated high settles comfortably near 45, presenting a backdrop painted in muted greys, ideal for those who find beauty in the soft glow of overcast skies. As the day unfolds, the gentle Southwest winds beckon an invitation to explore the quieter sides of the city. Perhaps a leisurely stroll through Boston Common or a visit to one of the charming cafes could serve as a delightful way to embrace the day\u2019s understated elegance\u2014perfect for sipping a warm beverage while wrapping one\u2019s hands around the comfort of a hot pastry.",
