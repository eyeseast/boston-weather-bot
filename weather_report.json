    "weather_report": "As dawn shyly breaks over Boston, the city is wrapped in a muted grayness that speaks more to the season than to any real chill in the air. The clouds drift lazily, painted in subtle tones of blue and ash, while a gentle breeze brushes against your cheeks\u2014perfect for a brisk morning stroll. Today, the temperature teeters around 49 degrees, a threshold of distinction that embodies the essence of late autumn. There\u2019s a soft rustling of leaves to remind you that winter isn\u2019t too far off; the air carries a hint of crispness, welcoming the day's promise without the bite of frost.\n\nAs the day unfolds, you might find it a pleasure to don a light jacket or a cozy sweater with a scarf to wrap around your neck\u2014a subtle armor against the briskness. Whether you choose to wander the quiet paths of the Public Garden or simply enjoy a cup of steaming coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, the briskness, paired with the cloud-filtered light, is a soothing balm. And as night draws near, the low temperature settles into the 30s, and the clouds will gradually part to reveal a more tranquil sky. In these moments, simple pleasures thrive\u2014perhaps a soft blanket while reading with a warm drink in hand, or a leisurely evening walk beneath the twilight sky as the city charms in its muted tones.",
