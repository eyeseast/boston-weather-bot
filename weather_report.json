    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, a crisp serenity envelops the city, ushering in the day with a promise of sunshine. The atmosphere feels refreshing, with temperatures modestly hovering around the low forties, soon to retreat to the mid-thirties as the afternoon progresses. A gentle south wind stirs, playful yet soothing, carrying hints of the warmth that will swell through the night.\n\nAs the sun inches higher, it casts a golden hue that dances upon the rooftops and sidewalks, inviting residents to step outside. Yet, the clouds that gather later may soften this radiance, hinting at the potential for rain as the clock ticks past one in the morning. Tonight promises both a break in temperature and a chance of showers, with the air turning a little heavier, drawing in the moisture that so often lingers in the atmosphere searching for an escape. It may be wise to don a light jacket, perhaps layered over a cozy sweater\u2014perfect for a day of casual strolls through the cobblestone streets or a quiet coffee on a cherished corner patio. As the evening settles, activities hint at a cozy night in, perhaps a warm cup of tea as you watch the clouds weave their way across the sky.",
