With a southwesterly breeze advancing and playful gusts dancing about, it feels like nature herself is beckoning Boston to come alive. A day like this calls for light layers\u2014perhaps a comfortable shirt or a light jacket for the earlier hours\u2014ensuring one remains at ease as the warmth crescendos. Venture out to explore a local park, or perhaps bring along a book to enjoy on a sun-drenched bench.
