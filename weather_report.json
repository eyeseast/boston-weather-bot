    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, a muted gray veil cloaks the city, shrouding its familiar skyline with a somber yet atmospheric elegance. The air hangs heavy with anticipation as rain begins to intermingle with the promise of snow, creating a tableau that is as whimsical as it is wintry. It would seem that the clouds have collectively conspired to deliver a day filled with a heady mix of precipitation and fog, leaving a chilly embrace around those brave enough to venture outdoors. The temperature is poised to hover near a mild 47 degrees, while gusty southeast winds flirt with the harried umbrellas of passersby.\n\nAs the day evolves into a symphony of moisture, one might consider donning layered attire\u2014perhaps a light waterproof jacket over a cozy sweater, paired with sensible boots to navigate the slick terrain. Outdoor plans may be best kept subdued, leaning towards inviting warmth found in a corner caf\u00e9, where the rich aroma of coffee lies in delightful contrast to the dampness outside. Here, one may pause to sip a steaming cup while watching the world blur past through a foggy window, savoring the hidden stories of those huddled against the weather. As evening descends, the fog may gradually lift, offering fleeting glimpses of clearer skies, but remain prepared for the remnants of rain and chilly breezes as night wraps its quiet embrace around the city.",
