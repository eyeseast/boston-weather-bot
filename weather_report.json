    "weather_report": "In the quiet embrace of midnight, Boston lies shrouded in a gentle veil of fog, softening the edges of the sprawling cityscape. The air feels warm, wrapping around you as you step outside, with whispers of moisture hanging in the atmosphere, echoing the forecast's hint of raindrops. As dawn breaks, the fog will intertwine with the day's early light, casting a mysterious glow over the morning hours, suggesting an enchanting ethereality. By the time the sun rises higher in the sky, expect a playful dance of warmth and clouds, with temperatures reaching toward a pleasant 82, particularly inviting after the embrace of humidity.\n\nFor those venturing out today, light layers will serve you well\u2014perhaps a comfortable t-shirt under a light jacket\u2014for the early hours will still hold traces of that misty ambiance, only to yield to the sun's gentle coaxing later on. Given the opportunity of the day ahead, consider a stroll along the river, taking in the sights as the city awakens and comes alive with the hum of activity. Perhaps savor a leisurely coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, where the aromas of morning mingle with the patter of conversation. And if a sprinkle graces your path, let it be a reminder of summer's fleeting dance, a moment to pause and appreciate the beauty of an ordinary day unfolding.",
