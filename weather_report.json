    "weather_report": "As the night leans into its deeper hours, Boston rests under a blanket of crisp clarity, the air fresh and invigorating. With temperatures dipping to around 33 degrees, a gentle wind whispers through the city, playfully tugging at clothing, urging you to wrap up warmly. The serene quiet of the nighttime landscape offers a tranquil elegance, perhaps prompting a midnight stroll to take in the shimmering lights of the skyline, with the faintest chill invigorating the spirit.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the promise of a sunny day unfolds, forecasted to greet the morning with clear blue skies and a high reaching toward 51 degrees. The gentle, westward breeze will continue, a companion that keeps the air lively but not overwhelming. It is a day that beckons outdoor pursuits\u2014perhaps a leisurely walk along the Charles River or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 where the warmth and aroma of fresh coffee invite reflection or conversation. Dress in layers; a knit scarf and a good coat will serve you well against the lingering chill of the morning, while a lighter ensemble will suffice as the sun ascends and bathes the city in comforting warmth. This day holds simple pleasures, an opportunity to enjoy the beauty of a late November in Boston.",
