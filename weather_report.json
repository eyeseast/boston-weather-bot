    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, the city is enveloped in a veil of patchy fog, lingering like a wisp of mystery on a sultry summer night. The air is heavy with humidity, with the promise of showers and sporadic thunderstorms looming ahead. A low of 67 degrees casts an almost languid feeling over the morning, while a soft breeze rustles the leaves, barely enough to break the stillness. The world feels hushed, as if holding its breath before the anticipated downpour, and the forecast speaks of a day where the sun may struggle to pierce the clouds, with temperatures inching towards a gentle 72.\n\nFor those venturing out, the day calls for attire that balances comfort with practicality. A light raincoat or a water-resistant jacket would serve well against sudden showers, while breathable fabrics beneath will ensure some ease when humid conditions prevail. Perhaps a stroll through the quiet streets of Boston would be in order, as the city awakens, or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 could offer a cozy refuge from the elements. As heavy rain may grace the afternoon, remaining indoors with a good book or catching up on conversations over a warm beverage might also be a delightful way to experience this New England summer day.",
