    "weather_report": "As the sun retreats into its nightly slumber, Boston basks in the lingering warmth of a summer evening. The air, saturated with the day\u2019s heat, holds a gentle whisper of a breeze, lightly rustling the leaves. With a temperature holding steady around 78 degrees, it feels notably sultry, the heat index nudging towards an almost stifling 99. Tonight, the sky remains unblemished by clouds, offering a canvas of deepening blues that presage a peaceful night ahead.\n\nLooking towards tomorrow, the forecast hints at an unfolding drama in the form of rain showers and thunderstorms sprouting through the late morning and early afternoon. Yet, before the day fully unfurls, a brief interlude of pleasant sunshine will greet early risers, temperatures peaking near 92, then settling back to a cooler embrace as the afternoon continues. The promise of rain could dampen the high spirits of a summer\u2019s day, so it might be wise to have an umbrella close at hand. Dress lightly but be prepared to adapt; breathable fabrics will serve you well under the sun\u2019s gaze and the oppressive humidity that accompanies it. As you ponder how to spend your day, a leisurely stroll along the Charles River could bring blissful moments of reflection and peace, perhaps mingled with the first raindrops that whisper promises of relief.\n\n#S0BAC0",
