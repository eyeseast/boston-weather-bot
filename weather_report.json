    "weather_report": "The air in Boston tonight carries an intimate chill, a gentle whisper that speaks of cushions wrapped in soft fabrics and the aroma of warm tea steaming gently on a nearby table. As night cloaks the city, expect areas of fog to drift in, mingling with the persistent drizzle, creating an almost ethereal quality to the surroundings. With clouds hanging low, the overall ambiance feels serene but slightly damp, as if the city is holding a secret beneath its gauzy cover. A light breeze hovers around, a quiet nod from the southeast, offering just enough warmth to let the chill be an afterthought.\n\nTomorrow anticipates a similar haze, with drizzle and fog weaving through the morning hours, before it decides to relent slightly toward midday. Temperatures will gently rise, inviting a modest reprieve and making room for a high that feels refreshingly mild. While the day may not scream for outdoor adventures, the subtlety of its grey tones invites reflection, perhaps a quiet walk through your favorite park cloaked in a cardigan, or a meander to a local caf\u00e9 bustling with life. The flavors of freshly brewed coffee or a comforting pastry become your companions against the damp chill, as the world outside hums softly beneath the veil of fog. Another chance to savor Boston in a way that feels both timeless and intimate.",
