    "weather_report": "As twilight deepens over Boston, the air carries a cool reminder of the evening, settling into the low 48s, a crispness felt as the westward breeze nudges the clouds in a gentle waltz. The sky, clothed in a mosaic of gray, hints at the day\u2019s lingering warmth but now gives way to a night of somber beauty\u2014mostly cloudy yet undeniably atmospheric. The soft whispers of the wind, moving at about 7 mph, beckon one to take a moment, perhaps appreciating the soft glow of city lights beginning to twinkle.\n\nTomorrow promises a shift, as the clouds will part to reveal a partly sunny day, leading us into a high near 64. This inviting temperature, combined with a gentle northwest breeze, will create the perfect conditions for an open-air stroll or a leisurely coffee on a sun-kissed patio. As the sun rises, the landscape will unfurl with a brush of warmth, making it a lovely day to wear light layers\u2014perhaps a lightweight sweater accompanied by a scarf to ward off the cool morning chill. Given these conditions, why not indulge in a visit to a neighborhood park? Bring along a book to read beneath the budding trees or simply take a moment to breathe in the fresh, fragrant air, as life in Boston embraces the beauty of the season.",
