    "weather_report": "As the night wraps Boston in its cool embrace, a thick blanket of clouds looms overhead, projecting a sense of quiet anticipation for the day to unfold. Currently, the mercury rests just below the freezing point, with a hint of warmth expected to weave its way into the night as the temperatures climb, momentarily defying the chill. The southern breeze whispers gently, a promise of the fog that will gradually reveal itself tomorrow, as a chance of rain swells on the horizon. \n\nFriday greets us with a moody promise of dampness and a swathe of clouds that will hover expectantly above the skyline. The day will begin with the soft patter of rain, likely mingling with the ghostly tendrils of fog. As the high climbs into the upper thirties, the dampness will evoke a sense of urgency in the busy hearts of the city. Consider donning a sturdy raincoat, perhaps layering it over a warm sweater; a scarf might soften the chill that clings to your neck. Waterproof footwear will serve you well for a leisurely stroll along the Esplanade or a cozy visit to one of Boston's inviting cafes, where the aroma of coffee fills the air, inviting respite from the dreariness. Tomorrow invites you to embrace the moment, to find joy in the muted elegance that follows the storm.",
