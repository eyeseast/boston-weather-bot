    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun envelopes Boston in a warm embrace, the day invites both adventure and leisure. With a gentle southwestern breeze rustling the treetops and casting playful shadows, one can feel the heat settling softly. The sky stretches wide and mostly clear, only peppered with fluffy clouds drifting lazily overhead, creating a canvas that shouts for exploration. While the heat index whispers of warm, sultry hours, the ambient humidity adds a tender heaviness, suggesting a late afternoon stroll by the Charles River, where the breeze might offer sweet relief from the weather's embrace.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the charm of a patchy fog emerges, a reminder of the cozy stillness that will blanket the city after sunset. Even as darkness creeps in, the prospect of a calm evening calls for light layers to ward off any possible chill that may arrive alongside that fog. So don a breathable cotton shirt, perhaps paired with comfortable shorts\u2014perfect for this balmy day. As the evening settles in, feel free to wander into a nearby caf\u00e9 or catch up with a friend over ice cream, indulging in the simple pleasures that Boston's warm summer evenings offer.",
