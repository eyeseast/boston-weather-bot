    "weather_report": "As night drapes its velvety cloak over Boston, the city rests in a tranquil hush, disturbed only by the soft resounding of a west wind that dances through the streets. With temperatures dipping toward twenty, the air carries a crispness that invigorates, inviting a warmth in the form of layered scarves and woolen coats. Tonight is dressed in clarity, shunning the fog that often clings stubbornly to the edges of winter evenings, revealing a canvas of stars peeking shyly through the inky sky. The twinkling of city lights offers a comforting glow, hinting at the life that pulses just beneath the surface.\n\nAs dawn approaches, tomorrow promises to be a sunlit embrace, with the golden rays coaxing the chill of the night away. A high near thirty-seven beckons for outings that explore the beauty of the day, perhaps a leisurely stroll through the Boston Common, where nature's slumber is slowly shaken awake, or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor a hot beverage while the world unfolds outside. Dress for this cheerful day in layers, perhaps donning a light sweater beneath a hefty coat to adapt gracefully to the swings in temperature, and consider warm mittens that can be readily slipped off at the sun's invitation. This is a day for quiet observations and simple pleasures\u2014a respite before the rhythms of the week resume.",
