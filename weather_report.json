    "weather_report": "As night descends over Boston, a muted calm blankets the city, accompanied by a gentle, westward breeze. With temperatures dipping into the low teens, the air feels crisp, almost rejuvenating, yet also carries an undeniable chill that nips at the exposed skin. The clouds, thin and sparse, linger in an almost melancholic embrace overhead, allowing only the faintest illumination from distant city lights to seep through. It\u2019s the kind of evening that urges residents to seek warmth indoors, perhaps wrapped in soft layers while sipping a steaming cup of tea or coffee, that comforting ritual of winter evenings.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, anticipation builds as the dawn promises mostly sunny skies\u2014a rare treat this time of year. A high near 38 degrees will offer moments of fleeting warmth juxtaposed against the briskness of a steady breeze. The day invites a leisurely stroll through the city\u2019s streets or a simple escape to a nearby caf\u00e9 for a quiet morning. Perhaps a light jacket layered over a sweater would suffice, balancing comfort with practicality as you navigate the still-chilly air. With clarity returning, the beauty of Boston, often cloaked in fog and gloom during the colder months, will shine through\u2014reminding all who wander her streets that the simplest pleasures, like basking in the winter sun, are those to treasure.",
