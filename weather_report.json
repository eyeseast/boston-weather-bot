You may step outside to feel the biting wind, with temperatures sinking to the low single digits, while the whispering breeze carries with it the sharpness of winter. Tonight's air is crisp, with wind chill pushing the cold deeper into your bones, urging you to wrap yourself in layers of warmth. A snug coat, a knitted scarf, and perhaps a hat are essential to ward off the frost that threatens to linger longer than invited.\n\nAs dawn peeks over the horizon, the sun will cast its soft, golden light across the city. Saturday promises to be a sunlit canvas of blue, though the biting temperatures will remain\u2014a reminder that winter is still a steadfast companion. The daytime high will climb modestly, enticing you to venture outdoors while also demanding caution against the lingering chill in the breeze. While the day may look invitingly bright, remember to dress warmly and embrace the briskness of the moment. A stroll through Boston Common, enjoying the tranquility of the park, or sipping a warm beverage at a favorite caf\u00e9 could be the perfect way to spend such a wonderfully brisk winter day.",
