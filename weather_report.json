    "weather_report": "In Boston, the afternoon reveals a splendid expanse of sunshine, wrapping the city in a gentle embrace, the vibrant blues of the sky juxtaposed against the vigorous rustle of tree branches stirred by a lively northwest wind. As daylight wanes towards evening, the temperature settles comfortably in the low 60s, casting a pleasant warmth over the streets yet hinting at the evening chill that beckons from the horizon with whispers of a 36-degree night ahead. The air is crisp but invigorating, and visibility stretches endlessly\u2014free from the veil of fog, offering splendid views of both urban and natural landscapes.\n\nAs the sun begins its descent, the tranquil beauty of this spring day invites exploration. Layering your attire will serve you well, allowing for the day's warmth to mingle with the approaching coolness\u2014perhaps a lightweight sweater over a simple shirt, paired with comfortable trousers for those strolling along the Charles or sitting on a park bench with a good book. Take a leisurely walk to soak in the canvas of a pleasing day, or perhaps indulge in an outdoor caf\u00e9 visit, where the cool breeze complements a warm cup of coffee, inspiring quiet conversations that drift like the puffy clouds overhead. Evening's calm beckons a chance to savor simplicity\u2014a moment to reflect, breathe deeply, and appreciate the serene beauty of a day well lived.",
