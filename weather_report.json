    "weather_report": "As the twilight hours linger in Boston, the night reveals a canvas of clarity with scattered glimmers of city lights flickering against the darkened sky. The air is crisp, a promise of frost hovering as the temperature gently dips towards the low twenties. With a mild west wind caressing the streets, late-night wanderers might find solace in a warm scarf and a sturdy coat, perfect companions for an evening stroll by the Charles or a quiet moment on a bench, admiring the shimmering skyline.\n\nCome Sunday, the day will awaken with an evolving personality. While the sun will make a tentative appearance, dappling the landscape with soft light, expect isolated rain showers to sprinkle the atmosphere after mid-afternoon, turning the partly sunny scenes into a nuanced interplay of clouds and fleeting sunshine. With temperatures rising towards the mid-forties, dressing in layered clothing will allow for the brisk chill of morning to transition comfortably into the balmy embrace of afternoon warmth. Those out and about might consider a mild jaunt to a local caf\u00e9, where one can savor the aroma of freshly brewed coffee while watching the world stir to life, or perhaps a visit to the museum, where the intriguing depths of art and history await amidst the gentle patter of rain.",
