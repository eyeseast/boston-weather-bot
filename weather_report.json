    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Boston, the city is cloaked in a calm, mostly clear expanse of sky. The night air is crisp, with temperatures dipping to a cool low of around 9 degrees, accompanied by a gentle northwest wind that dances through the streets. Although the gusts may stir up the air at times, creating an exhilarating breeze, the overall atmosphere remains serene, inviting moments of quiet reflection as the city lights twinkle like scattered stars.\n\nLooking ahead to Friday, the sun will grace Boston with its presence, promising a splendid day filled with warmth as temperatures approach a comfortable 26 degrees. Under the gentle caress of a southwest breeze, it is an opportune time to venture outside once morning breaks, perhaps enjoying a leisurely walk along the Charles River or exploring one of the many parks. As you prepare for what is likely to be a pleasant day, consider wrapping yourself in layers that keep you cozy without being cumbersome, allowing you to bask in the crispness of the morning air. Whether it be a moment of solitude or a gathering with friends in a favorite caf\u00e9, the day beckons with the promise of rejuvenation and simple joys.",
