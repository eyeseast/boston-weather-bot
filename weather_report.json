    "weather_report": "In the quiet embrace of night, Boston lies beneath a shroud of clouds, with a faint chance of rain lingering in the air. The temperatures cool to a moderate chill, hovering around the mid-forties, inviting you to wrap yourself in something warm. If you choose to venture out, a light jacket and comfortable shoes would serve well, perfect for an evening stroll amid the city's twinkling lights that punctuate the dark sky. The wind, gentle yet persistent, carries whispers of moisture, hinting at the restless nature of the coming hours.\n\nAs dawn unfurls her delicate fingers, the promise of a mostly cloudy Saturday looms ahead. Showers may find their way into the day after breakfast, with a high that could coax the mercury closer to sixty. While the clouds might dull the vibrancy of the sun, they also provide a cozy atmosphere perfect for indoor pursuits. Think of a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9 or perhaps a quiet afternoon spent perusing the shelves of your favorite bookstore. Engage with the unhurried pace of the day, draped in layers to adapt to the coolness that lingers. Let the rhythmic pulse of the city guide your way, as you find comfort in the serene and sometimes unpredictable beauty of Boston's early summer.",
