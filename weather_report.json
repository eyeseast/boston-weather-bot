    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Boston, a blanket of clouds hangs low in the sky, dulling the sun's rays and casting a muted light over the city. With temperatures hovering around a chilly 38 degrees, the air carries a crispness that bites slightly against the skin. A gentle west wind stirs, providing a subtle movement that is almost refreshing, mingling with the stillness of the day. As evening approaches, the clouds will part slightly, ushering in a low of about 22 degrees, inviting a quilted layer of warmth against the chill.\n\nThe weather invites a modest sense of coziness, perfect for pulling on a warm sweater, a reliable coat, and perhaps even a scarf to seal out the cold when stepping outdoors. Today is well-suited for leisurely activities\u2014strolling through a nearby park where the muted colors of winter can be observed, or perhaps enjoying a moment at a local caf\u00e9, cradling a warm drink while watching the world go by. The weather may not beg for excitement, but it fosters a welcoming atmosphere for quiet reflection or respite from life\u2019s hustle, under the evolving yet unremarkable sky.",
