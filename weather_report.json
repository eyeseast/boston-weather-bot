    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Boston, a dim yet intriguing stillness blankets the city, with temperatures dipping to around 11 degrees. The evening sky holds a whisper of clouds, casting a veil over the flickering lights of the urban landscape. The gentle hum of a westward breeze at about five miles per hour carries a chill that sharpens the air, making it a night best spent indoors by the warmth of a fire or with a good book tucked under your arm. \n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, the promise of a winter's flirtation looms, as the day breaks with a hint of sunlight amidst scattered clouds. The temperature will rise to a high near 33 degrees, but there\u2019s a chance of snow dusting the ground after four in the afternoon, bringing with it the possibility of delicate white flakes whispering against the pavement. With a 30% chance of snow and forecasted accumulation under half an inch, one can imagine a quiet joy in the simplicity of a walk, perhaps along the Charles River, or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee can warm your hands. Dressing in layers will be a wise choice; a well-insulated coat, a scarf, and sturdy boots should carry you comfortably through the day\u2019s chill and snow flurries. As snowflakes begin to kiss the ground, the city will transform into a serene tapestry, inviting you to pause and savor the fleeting beauty of winter.",
