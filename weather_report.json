    "weather_report": "As the quiet hours of the morning unfurl over Boston, the atmosphere holds a gentle warmth that dances lightly on the skin. Anticipation hangs in the air like the muted glow of distant city lights, hinting at the beckoning sun. Overnight, the skies have settled into a partly cloudy embrace, the low temperature cradling the air at a comfortable 67 degrees. The inviting whispers of a southwest wind weave through the night, setting the stage for what lies ahead.\n\nThe day promises a radiant spectacle as the sun ascends, draping the city in vibrant sunshine and painting the sky with deeper blues. With a high forecasted near 93 degrees, those stepping outside will soon feel the heat\u2019s embrace. Yet it\u2019s the heat index\u2014projected to soar to 96\u2014that suggests a certain heaviness in the air, urging residents to prepare for the day's sweat-laden activities. Light fabrics will be paramount for comfort; a simple cotton shirt and breathable shorts will serve well against the enveloping warmth. The early afternoon would favor leisure walks along the Charles River, where the gentle splash of water may offer reprieve. Perhaps there\u2019s a book you\u2019ve been meaning to start or a caf\u00e9 with a shady patio awaiting your presence, its cool drinks tempting you from the sun\u2019s pursuit.\n\nAs the clock ticks softly toward midday, consider forgoing more strenuous activities until the sun begins its descent. Instead, while the city basks in the gold of the day, find grateful moments in the shade of leafy trees or beneath the cool awnings of your local establishments. Embrace the slower pace, allowing time to drift lazily yet purposefully through the sultry spells of summer.",
