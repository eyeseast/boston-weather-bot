    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, the atmosphere is draped in a blanket of patchy fog, blending with the light murmur of showers and distant rumbles of thunder. The sky, a heavy quilt of clouds, hints at an impending downpour, waiting just beneath the surface. With a high of around 71 degrees, the air feels warm, yet the moisture clings to the skin, a reminder of the storms lurking nearby. A gentle northeast breeze carries whispers of rain, poised to deliver a steady embrace of hydration. This blend of warm and damp creates a distinctly unpredictable ambiance, one that lures you to pause and wonder about the outdoors.\n\nAs night approaches, the fog will likely deepen, holding onto the remnants of the day's warmth while a chill sets in with a low dipping to near 58. Evenings spent under this hazy veil have their charm; consider wrapping yourself in something cozy, perhaps a light sweater or a shawl, as you venture out. The possibility of sprinkles keeps the evening dynamic, perhaps inviting you to settle in at a favorite caf\u00e9 for a warm beverage, or meandering through the fog-drenched streets, surrounded by the soft glow of street lamps. This is a time for quiet exploration, a Sunday yet seemingly alive with the promise of renewal under the shifting clouds.",
