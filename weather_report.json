    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Boston this evening, a gentle haze envelops the skyline, hinting at the patchy fog mentioned in the forecast. The atmosphere feels thick with the promise of subtle moisture, a precursor to the showers and perhaps an occasional rumble of thunder that may arrive later in the night. With the temperature settling around a comfortable 61 degrees, the night air carries a humid warmth, ideal for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or an evening spent on a cozy porch, wrapped in a light shawl.\n\nTomorrow's forecast carries a similar thread, with the prospect of more fog and a slight chance for isolated thunderstorms weaving through the fabric of a mostly cloudy day. Highs will push towards 76, creating an inviting backdrop for quiet pursuits. One might choose to visit a local caf\u00e9 for a few hours, savoring a book or engaging in light conversation over steaming cups of coffee as the clouds keep the sun playfully at bay. For those drawn outdoors, breathable clothing paired with a light jacket would be appropriate, allowing for comfort against the shifting weather. As night gives way to day, the world outside may feel a little more serene, perfect for engaging with the subtleties of life in this vibrant city.",
