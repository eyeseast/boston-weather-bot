    "weather_report": "The night in Boston unfolds under a shroud of clouds, whispering promises of rain and snow as it hovers just above 35 degrees. As the clock insists on moving forward, the world outside seems to hold its breath, waiting for precipitation to dance upon the pavement. With a breeze from the southeast gently scuffling through, the moisture in the air thickens with anticipation, hinting at the 90% chance of wetness that awaits. For those venturing out in the early hours, dressing in layers is wise\u2014a water-resistant coat, perhaps, paired with sturdy shoes to brave the possibility of splashes, as the forecast speaks of snowflakes joining the rain in a delicate waltz.\n\nAs dawn breaks, Friday reveals itself with a more definitive texture. Snow may greet the landscape before 9 AM, transforming the day into a canvas of muted white against the gray clouds. The air carries an 80% chance of lingering winter's touch post-snowfall, as a light east wind carries those flurries along in a gentle reminder that spring is still finding its footing. Ideal for a quiet morning, a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm drink or a stroll through a nearby park might prove delightful, with the quietude of a Friday morning beckoning for reflection. As the high reaches around 47, consider opting for practical attire\u2014perhaps a warm hat and gloves to accompany your exploration, as the air remains brisk but invigorating. In the embrace of this wintry embrace, Boston reveals its charm\u2014a true symphony of the seasons inviting us to savor the moment.",
