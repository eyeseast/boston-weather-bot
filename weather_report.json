    "weather_report": "Boston greets the afternoon with a warm embrace of sunshine, the sky stretching wide and clear above, hinting at a blissful spring day. As you journey through the city, you'll feel a gentle westward breeze, a companion inviting you to explore the cobblestone streets or sit by the harbor, where the water glimmers like polished glass. The temperature hovers comfortably, urging you to shed heavier layers and don something light yet cozy against the subtle shift of the evening to come.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the sky will softly transition to night, bringing with it a whisper of clouds that partially blankets the stars. The air will cool noticeably but will remain pleasantly brisk as the temperature dips into the low fifties. A light jacket will serve well for anyone planning a leisurely stroll along the Esplanade or unwinding in one of Boston\u2019s many parks. For those who crave a bit of adventure, an impromptu picnic or a casual reading session in the park is perfectly in tune with the inviting atmosphere of the day. As the sun's radiant glow begins to fade, we are reminded of the beauty in simple moments, making today an unmistakable delight to experience.",
