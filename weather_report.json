    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours before dawn, Boston clings to a blanket of muted darkness, the streets shrouded in patchy fog that swathes the city in a ghostly embrace. As the winds whisper softly through the trees, a South breeze stirs, promising to awaken the day with a certain chill. Temperatures linger near the 40-degree mark, hinting at coolness that lingers in the air long past the light of day. The clouds overhead, thick and brooding, carry the promise of rain, their somber hue suggesting a day that might not lift.\n\nAs the clock ticks onward, the prospect for Friday materializes as one of layered clouds and intermittent showers. The looming possibility of rain as temperatures reach the low 50s suggests a day best spent indoors. Should you venture out, wrap yourself in a warm, water-resistant coat and a soft scarf, allowing the day's dampness not to dampen your spirit. With visibility diminished, perhaps consider a tranquil morning stroll through Boston\u2019s charming neighborhoods, where the patter of raindrops on leaves forms a delightful soundtrack, or dive into the welcoming warmth of a local caf\u00e9, savoring a comforting beverage as you watch the world awaken, each drop of rain a reminder of nature\u2019s quiet rhythm.",
