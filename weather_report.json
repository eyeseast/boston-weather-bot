    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Boston, a shroud of muted gray cloaks the sky, hinting at the slight chance of snow flurries that may materialize after dawn. The gentle breath of a northwest wind stirs through the streets, whispering of a night where temperatures dip to a crisp 25 degrees. The air carries that quintessential winter chill, a reminder of the season's grip, yet the city remains alive with a soft glow from its streetlights and distant buildings, casting a calm but bustling ambiance to those who venture out into its embrace.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the forecast suggests that the clouds will deepen, perhaps releasing a light dusting of snow that could blanket the city in a serene white. The high will hover around 32, a numbing but manageable chill for those prepared. As you consider your attire, layered clothing, including a warm coat, scarf, and resilient boots would serve you well, navigating between the warmth of indoor comforts and the brisk air outside. The snowfall, although not heavy, beckons gentle pursuits\u2014one might take a leisurely walk through the parks, watch the soft flakes swirl in the streetlights, or perhaps settle into a cozy caf\u00e9 with a warm drink, enveloped in the winter\u2019s embrace.",
