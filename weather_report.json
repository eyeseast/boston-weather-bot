    "weather_report": "Tonight in Boston, the air is cloaked in a misty embrace, with drizzle settling over the landscape like a whisper that softens the edges of the city. Conditions are notably hazy, with visibility compromised by the gentle fog that weaves through the streets, inviting a slower pace. As the temperature hovers around a brisk 36 degrees, a mild southwest wind adds a touch of chill to the evening, urging you to reach for your warmest layers. A snug coat, perhaps, accompanied by a scarf, would serve well against the dampness rising from the ground.\n\nAs Sunday dawns, the weather continues to be marked by the presence of fog and drizzle, likely lingering until late morning. By noon, the clouds will remain a steadfast companion, with temperatures creeping toward a slightly warmer high near 46. Despite the sporadic drizzle and a hint of rain in the air\u2014accompanied by a gentle breeze from the south\u2014there exists a peculiar charm in this muted atmosphere. A stroll through the quiet streets could reveal tranquil scenes, untouched by the stir of the usual weekend bustle. Cozy cafes beckon for a leisurely cup of coffee, where one might get lost in a good book while watching the world go by through fogged windows. In such weather, one might savor the simple pleasure of a warm drink, wrapped in soft layers, while the city gently awakens beneath a gray veil.",
