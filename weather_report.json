    "weather_report": "In the quiet embrace of early morning, Boston wakes under a thick veil of patchy fog, obscuring the familiar skyline and wrapping the day in a shroud of mystery. Visibility is low, and the air is cool\u2014almost crisp\u2014suggesting a soft touch of rain that lingers on the horizon until around mid-afternoon. As the clouds gather overhead, they promise the possibility of snow, teasing us with a light dusting that may accumulate ever so slightly. This haunting atmosphere makes for a rather melancholic beginning, yet there is something charming about the muted tones of a city emerging from sleep amidst fog and overcast skies.\n\nAs the day progresses, one might dress in layers, opting for a cozy sweater or a warm coat paired with a hat to keep the chill at bay. The outlook hints at an eventual shift to snowy whispers as the sun fades, inviting you to curl up with a good book or venture out to explore a quiet caf\u00e9 where warm drinks await. Perhaps a stroll through empty streets to absorb the gentle crunch of anticipated snow underfoot, or contemplating the day ahead from the comfort of your window could be a cozy alternative. Whatever you choose, the weather whispers of quiet pleasures and a moment to savor the softness of the day.",
