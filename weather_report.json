    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Boston, the sun shines brightly against a backdrop of blue skies, setting the scene for an invigorating winter day. With temperatures reaching into the high 40s, the chill in the air is tempered by a gentle southward breeze. A chance of rain looms on the horizon for tonight, with clouds beginning to gather, promising the possibility of dampness after 10 PM. As temperatures climb overnight, the winds may whisper more fervently, inviting a cozy atmosphere perfect for settling in. \n\nFor those venturing outdoors, it's best to don a light jacket layered over a warm sweater to keep the chill at bay while enjoying the mildness of the afternoon sun. A stroll along the Charles or a quiet moment in one of Boston\u2019s charming coffee shops would suit the spirit of this day, allowing one to relish the subtle changes in the landscape. As the evening draws near and clouds assemble, perhaps consider curling up with a good book or planning for a leisurely indoor activity, preparing for the gentle rainfall that promises to blanket the city in a soothing embrace.",
