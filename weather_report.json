    "weather_report": "As the night wraps Boston in its gentle embrace, a shroud of clouds flits overhead, with temperatures hovering around a brisk 35 degrees. The westward wind, a quiet companion, whispers through the streets at roughly 9 mph, inviting a chill that is both invigorating and a reminder of winter's approach. As midnight wanders close, one can find a stillness in the air, the city lights glimmering like a constellation of stars below a canopy of muted gray.\n\nAs dawn breaks, a promise of sun glimmers on the horizon, heralding a sunny Monday that will see the temperature rise to a high near 41 degrees before retreating back to that familiar crispness. The day promises clarity \u2014 a welcome departure from the clouded night \u2014 though the wind will play its part, gusting up to 23 mph. With this in mind, it may be wise to don layers; a smart sweater beneath a sharper jacket will keep warmth close while allowing ease of movement. As for the day's pursuits, one might indulge in a brisk stroll along the harbor's edge, where the sun dances on the water, or perhaps engage in a leisurely coffee in one of the quaint cafes that dot the Back Bay. Every moment spent outdoors will be a small respite, a gentle reminder to savor the brisk beauty that early December in Boston offers.",
