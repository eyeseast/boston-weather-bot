Expect the day to delve into a flirtation with thunderstorms this evening, but for now, the air is thick with the promise of summer. The clouds drift lazily, adding an architectural interest to the horizon while whispers of a southwest wind offer a welcome reprieve from the heat. The high, flirting near 92, transforms the streets into sunlit pathways, urging locals to embrace a fleeting, vibrant energy. \n\nAs the light wanes, temperatures will dip to a comfortable 62, prompting thoughts of a light jacket or perhaps a soft sweater for the evening. With rain on the horizon, a stroll through the narrow, historic streets might unveil hidden caf\u00e9s perfect for a quiet conversation, or a serene park might be the ideal backdrop for a moment of reflection before the sky potentially opens up with its cooling refreshments. Consider venturing out, absorbing the warm glow before the clouds muster their strength. Here, every corner sings a tune of nostalgia, in the subdued cadence of twilight\u2019s embrace.",
