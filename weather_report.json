    "weather_report": "In Boston, this afternoon offers a canvas of shifting hues, where partly sunny skies swirl into soft concentrations of fluffy clouds. A gentle northeast breeze tousles the air, bringing a hint of freshness with each breath. With temperatures hovering just shy of 70 degrees, the day feels inviting, yet the whisper of possible light rain reminds us to be prepared for moments of unpredictability. As dusk approaches, the skies will deepen, but the evening should maintain a pleasant warmth, settling down around 58 as the northeast wind continues its serenade.\n\nFor those venturing out, this is an ideal day for layers\u2014perhaps a light cardigan over a simple shirt, making it easy to adapt with the changing winds. You might find pleasure in a stroll along the Charles River, where the reflections of the day\u2019s clouds mingle with the water, or perhaps visit a local caf\u00e9, where the warmth inside provides refuge from the chill of evening. Embrace the calmness of a midweek escape, allowing the weather to guide your afternoon pursuits gently.",
