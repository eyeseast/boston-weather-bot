    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Boston, a gentle snowfall is beginning to embrace the city, weaving a quilt of white across the streets and rooftops. The air carries a crisp chill, the kind that seeps into your bones, with gusts of wind that tell tales of winter's fierce temperament. With temperatures hovering around 24 degrees, the scene outside feels both ethereal and stark, a reminder of nature\u2019s quieter moods. Visibility may be diminishing as the darkness deepens, obscured by snowflakes swirling in the breeze, making it a perfect night to retreat indoors with a warm drink or perhaps a cozy blanket.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the promise of partial sunshine will contrast sharply with the night\u2019s snowfall, hinting at a merciful thaw from the cold. Though the high will only reach near 31, the winds will be light, allowing for a calmer experience outside than tonight\u2019s tumultuous gusts. Layering will be essential, with a warm coat, sturdy boots, and perhaps a scarf wrapped snugly around one's neck as you step out into the winter day. For those drawn to the outdoors, a brisk walk through the softly dusted parks or a leisurely visit to a local coffee shop might provide a moment of enjoyment, allowing you to appreciate the hushed beauty of a city dressed in winter's finest.",
