    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the night, Boston finds itself wrapped in clouds that whisper hints of rain, the air tinged with a gentle chill that beckons to those tucked away in homes, contemplating the hours ahead. The chance of fleeting showers hangs lightly in the atmosphere, but the warmth of an approaching dawn promises solace. As the sun rises, the day will unfold into a tapestry of blue skies, casting a serene light over the city. With a high near 71, the warmth of the day will invite one to step outside, perhaps to stroll through familiar streets or savor a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s many delightful parks.\n\nAs you prepare for the day, consider donning layers that will embrace the morning\u2019s coolness while remaining light enough for the warmth anticipated by midday. A light jacket or cardigan could serve as a comforting companion for the morning hours when the northeast winds gently remind us of summer's tender transition toward fall. Given the clarity of the day unfolding, an afternoon excursion may be in order\u2014perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 or a leisurely exploration of the waterfront, all while soaking up the tranquil vibe of this spirited city.",
