    "weather_report": "As the afternoon dwindles, Boston finds itself under a shroud of mostly gray cloud cover, painting the skyline in muted tones of indigo and slate. The air is cool, brushing against your skin\u2014a high near 51 degrees, a gentle reminder that winter has settled in. The south wind, only a whisper at about seven miles per hour, carries with it the scent of moisture from the looming rain, foreshadowing a night likely drenched in drizzles and soft fog. As twilight approaches, expect the clouds to deepen, and the chance of rain grows stronger, inviting the kind of cozy introspection that a quiet evening in can foster.\n\nFor those stepping outside, a layered approach is your best ally; an easy sweater beneath a light jacket will suit the coolness of the air, while waterproof shoes might serve to ward off the evening's dampness. Perhaps an unhurried stroll amidst the fading light, or a warm gathering at a local caf\u00e9, would be fitting\u2014comfortably seated and gazing out at the muted cityscape, enjoying a cup of something rich and aromatic. As the day drifts toward night, let the soft embrace of the fog, when it arrives, weave its magic into the city, transforming familiar sights into something tender and surreal.",
