    "weather_report": "As darkness envelops Boston, the city is held in a gentle embrace of clouds that drift languidly across the night sky, hinting at the warmth of a low around 70 degrees. A soft southwest wind stirs, whispering promises of a brighter morn to come. With dawn just on the horizon, the chill of the night gives way to a day that unfolds under a brilliant sun, coaxing the temperatures upward to near 83 degrees. The winds will pick up, dancing energetically, gusting fiercely, as if the very air is excited to greet an invigorating summer day.\n\nAs you embrace the unfolding morning, consider a light ensemble that dances between comfort and style. Breathable fabrics will serve you well as you navigate the warmth and the brisk breezes that beckon from the west. The radiance of the sun calls for a casual stroll, perhaps along the Charles River, where the water mirrors the blue of the sky, or through the fragrant pathways of a nearby park, each step filled with the symphony of nature awakening. Amidst the bustling local cafes, the lure of sipping a freshly brewed coffee while soaking in the ambiance proves irresistible. Such moments can transform an ordinary Friday into an experience to savor.",
