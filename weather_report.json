    "weather_report": "As the early hours of Sunday unfold, Boston is enveloped in a cloak of fog and drizzle, the city shrouded in a soft haze that lingers in the air like whispered secrets. The temperatures are dipping, lending an unmistakable chill as the night quietly shifts toward morning. The clouds loom overhead, heavy with the promise of rain showers, and a gentle breeze from the east stirs the atmosphere, carrying with it the earthy scent of impending moisture. The dim glow of street lamps competes with the oncoming fog, creating a somewhat ethereal ambiance, yet the daylight remains reluctant, hidden behind layers of gray.\n\nAs dawn breaks and the day progresses, expect the fog to persist, wrapping itself around Boston until the late morning, perfectly mirroring the weather forecast. A frigid high of 40 degrees awaits as rain showers make their predicted appearance, appropriately echoing the mood of this early spring day. Dressing in layers would serve you well; opt for a warm jacket, perhaps knit gloves, and a water-resistant umbrella to keep dry while you traverse the city. The murky conditions might prompt you to take refuge in a cozy caf\u00e9, sipping on something warm, or perhaps meandering through an art gallery, where the vibrancy of colors can contrast beautifully against the muted hues outside. It\u2019s a day best suited for introspection, nurturing oneself against the encroaching chill, while allowing the city\u2019s character to emerge beneath the surface, waiting patiently for the warmth of spring.",
