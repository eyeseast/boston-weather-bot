    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Boston this evening, a crispness hangs in the air, whispering of the chill that October nights often bring. The sky remains mostly clear, allowing the stars to peek through, though the temperature will soon dip into the low thirties, inviting one to reach for a warm jacket or perhaps a favorite shawl. A gentle breeze from the southwest adds just a hint of briskness, barely rustling the leaves, a reminder of the seasonal shift at play.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the morning may awaken with patches of sun filtering through, but by afternoon, clouds will gather ominously, hinting at a chance of rain. Highs near sixty will provide a brief warmth, before temperatures descend reminiscent of the evening chill. As grey clouds loom, consider opting for layers\u2014perhaps an adaptable sweater or a light raincoat, just in case the sky decides to shed its moisture. The unpredictable nature of the day offers a wonderful chance to stroll through the parks, contemplating the ever-changing landscape while savoring a warm cup of coffee or tea. Alternatively, this could be a perfect time to catch up on an afternoon read, wrapped in a cozy blanket.",
