    "weather_report": "As dawn stretches its arms across Boston, the air bears a crispness that speaks of winter\u2019s lingering grasp. With temperatures hovering around the chill of 4 degrees, today's high promises to gently breach the 20-degree mark, though the wind chill may make the day feel like it\u2019s clinging stubbornly to the cusp of freezing. A partly sunny visage is expected as the sun lifts higher into the morning sky, gradually revealing a clearer atmosphere, albeit with a whisper of chill in the air from the west winds. It is a day that invites warmth through layers\u2014perhaps a smartly woven scarf and a well-insulated coat to ward off the biting breeze.\n\nIn such conditions, a crisp afternoon stroll along the riverbank could prove invigorating, perhaps even more delightful with a warm beverage cradled in your hands. Those who embrace the chill might find joy in a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the scent of freshly brewed coffee or hot chocolate offers a pleasant retreat from the cold. As evening treads softly upon Boston, the temperatures will retreat again, urging one to don an extra layer or two. Tonight, the sky holds onto its partly cloudy nature, but a gentle calm prevails, promising a cozy respite as the city settles into its evening rhythm.",
