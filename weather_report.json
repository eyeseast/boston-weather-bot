    "weather_report": "As the clock inches toward midnight in Boston, the city wears the serene garb of a clear night, the crispness enveloping the air like a gentle embrace. The temperatures are poised to dip into the low twenties, inviting a sense of briskness that invigorates the soul. The stillness of the night is punctuated by a subtle northwest breeze, stirring the shadows of the trees and whispering secrets of warmth to come. The scene is tranquil, illuminated only by the tender glow of distant lights that echo the heartbeat of the city.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will rise to unveil a day steeped in clarity and brightness, with skies washed in blue and a high near thirty-eight degrees. This promise of sunshine calls for layered attire; a snug sweater beneath a warm coat, perhaps a knitted scarf to fend off the morning chill. As the sun ascends, warmth will weave its way into the day, beckoning residents outdoors. A stroll along the Charles River or a visit to one of Boston's quaint cafes could offer modest delights for those seeking a taste of leisure amid the serene ambiance. The weather urges one to embrace the simple pleasures of the season, where tranquility reigns and the world unfolds like a story yet to be told.",
