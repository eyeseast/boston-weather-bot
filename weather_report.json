    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Boston, the atmosphere is layered with a gentle warmth, hinting at the balmy night ahead. Tonight's low relinquishes the summer's heat, settling comfortably around 75 degrees. A soft southwest breeze stirs lazily, carrying with it the promise of clearer skies. The stars may peek through the gradually darkening canvas, suggesting a serene, albeit warm, evening.\n\nCome Tuesday, the city will awaken to an unyielding sun that brightens the horizon. It is destined to reach a staggering peak of around 102 degrees, with a heat index that may make it feel even hotter. Residents should prepare for an intense day, where the heat wraps around like the embrace of an old friend, tight yet familiar. Dressing lightly in breathable fabrics becomes essential\u2014think loose cotton shirts and sun hats to shield against the blaze. Afternoon strolls will be best enjoyed in shaded parks or alongside the calming banks of the Charles River, where the gentle whisper of water provides a welcome reprieve. \n\nIndoors, local caf\u00e9s offer a refuge, inviting you to savor iced coffee or a chilled lemonade while engaging in quiet conversation. Whether you opt for a lazy afternoon with a book or a leisurely exploration of quiet neighborhoods, the day promises its own rhythm, vibrant yet comfortable, all under the watchful eye of the sun.",
