    "weather_report": "As evening settles softly over Boston, the sky holds a quiet beauty, partly obscured but gently lit by the scattered lights of the city. The temperature hovers around a cool 35 degrees, and the faint whisper of wind from the southwest drifts through the air, bringing a sense of calm to the night. Wrapped in a cozy jacket or perhaps a light scarf, one might venture out to savor the crispness of the evening, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River or a quiet night spent lingering over a warm drink indoors at a favorite caf\u00e9.\n\nLooking ahead, tomorrow promises a delightful shift in the atmosphere. With mostly sunny skies greeting the day, the high will rise to a refreshing 57 degrees, complemented by a playful breeze from the west. This invigorating weather invites outdoor pursuits; perhaps a visit to the historic Beacon Hill to admire the charming architecture or a relaxed walk through the Boston Public Garden to watch the early spring flowers bloom. As the sun shines bright and high, wearing layers will keep one comfortable\u2014something light for the mild temperatures, paired with a jacket to embrace the breezy moments. So let the day unfold gently, with all the promise it brings.",
