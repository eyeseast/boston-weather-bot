The air feels heavy with moisture, a gentle reminder of the fog that clings to the buildings and streets. While the temperature hovers near the chilly forties, there\u2019s a palpable chill that invites a snug embrace of layers. The northeastern wind whispers softly as it sweeps through the city, adding to the sense of a day still waking from slumber.\n\nAs the hours progress, the likelihood of rain increases, settling into the evening with the promise of warmth as temperatures drift towards the mid-forties. The cloudy sky will likely remain, draping the city in a blanket that softens the edges of its busy life. It\u2019s an ideal day for leisurely pursuits\u2014perhaps ducking into a cozy caf\u00e9 for a steaming cup of coffee or indulging in that book you\u2019ve been meaning to explore. As you move through the day, dressing warmly, perhaps adding a scarf to ward off the dampness, will keep you comfortable as you navigate the soft wetness of Boston\u2019s streets.",
