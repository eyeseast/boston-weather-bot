The air carries a crisp chill, inviting those braving the evening to wrap themselves in warm layers\u2014a cozy scarf and a thick coat would do well to ward off the biting cold. Tonight, the temperature dips to a modest 27, leaving a nostalgic reminder of winter\u2019s embrace as the northwest wind whispers through the streets.\n\nLooking towards Tuesday, a gray morning awaits, possibly softening into patchy freezing drizzle interspersed with a few reluctant snowflakes, creating a delicate tableau of muted color. The high near 35 does not promise much relief from the cool climes, but the light southwest winds might coax a few brave souls outside. It is a day to seek solace indoors, perhaps with a book at a favorite caf\u00e9, or find company among friends over steaming mugs warmed by conversation. As the world outside remains subdued, it may be best to savor the sheltered moments, cocooned against the whims of this quiet winter day.",
