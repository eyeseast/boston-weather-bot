    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, a somber veil of rain settles over the city, wrapping everything in a damp embrace. The air hangs thick and chilly, filled with the promise of steady drops that will become a familiar lullaby as the hours pass. Gloomy clouds dapple the sky, obscuring the sun's warmth, and as the gentle north wind whispering through the streets picks up speed, one can almost hear the anticipation of the evening's gusts.\n\nTonight, the rain will give way to a mercifully brief respite, the darkening sky revealing a chill that tumbles into the low twenties. Those venturing out should dress in layers, wrapping themselves snugly in heavier outerwear, warm scarves, and sturdy shoes that can withstand the rugged terrain left by the downpour. This is not a time for outdoor revelry; instead, consider settling indoors with a good book, perhaps near a window to listen to the rain as it taps a rhythmic pattern against the panes. Alternatively, a warm, inviting caf\u00e9 might beckon, where one can wind down with a hot beverage, watching the world morph into shades of gray outside. The curtain of drizzle casts a quiet spell on the city, encouraging reflection and solitude, inviting you to embrace the stillness of a damp winter evening.",
