A gentle northwest breeze, barely stirring, whispers through the streets, imparting a sense of calm. As the sun makes its gradual descent, expect a shift; patchy fog will creep in as evening approaches, teasing visibility with its enigmatic shroud. By late night, freezing fog might join the mix, casting the world into a delicate, ethereal state where clarity is momentarily relinquished to the night.\n\nFor those contemplating a venture outdoors today, light layers will serve well\u2014perhaps a warm sweater beneath a light jacket to accommodate the chill of the afternoon and the impending embrace of night. It is a fine day for a stroll through Boston\u2019s inviting parks, where the lingering glow of the sun mingles with the rustle of leaves, offering solace before fog settles in. Alternatively, a quiet moment with a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9 might just capture the spirit of the season as you watch the city transition from day to night, observing how its charm transforms under the cloak of mist.",
