A sturdy jacket, perhaps a soft scarf, and a pair of comfortable boots should suffice as you prepare for the rain, which is nearly certain to grace the morning hours. As the fog rolls in, obscuring the familiar skyline, it invites you to explore the quieter corners of the city or perhaps linger at a favorite caf\u00e9, savoring the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee. It\u2019s a day not meant for grand pursuits but rather for intimate gatherings and tranquil moments, where the soft symphony of rain might encourage a good book or an unhurried conversation with a friend. So content yourself in the simple joys that this weather brings, wrapped in warmth both from your attire and the company you choose to keep.",
