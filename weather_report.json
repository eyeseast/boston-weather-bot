    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Boston ushers in a refreshing clarity, the sun gracing the scene with its gentle warmth as the temperature hovers near the cool side of comfort. A northwest breeze weaves through the streets, lightly tousling hats and hair, while the vibrant sky radiates a crisp blue, unmarred by fog or haze. As dusk approaches, expect the air to cool even further, settling into a serene calm, ideal for a quiet evening beneath the stars.\n\nIn terms of attire, a light jacket or sweater will serve well against the brisk air, allowing you to embrace the outdoors without succumbing to the chill. A stroll along the Charles River could be a delightful option, where reflections dance upon the water and the day\u2019s end paints the sky in subtle pastels. Alternatively, perhaps an evening visit to one of Boston\u2019s charming caf\u00e9s, accompanied by a steaming cup of coffee or tea, would be an inviting way to unwind and relish the tranquil vibe of the city as it transitions into night.",
