    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the atmosphere carries a whisper of possibility, with just a hint of rain fluttering at the edges of a partly sunny sky. The day unfolds under the gentle embrace of a southwestern breeze, pushing clouds along while inviting the sun's soft warmth. As temperatures politely dance between highs that flirt with fifty and a retreat towards the chill of the afternoon, a shiver might remind you that winter is still in attendance. The chance of precipitation remains low, lingering around a modest twenty percent. \n\nAs twilight nears, the ambiance shifts: a quiet likelihood of rain and even snow showers may creep into the evening. With the night descending, temperatures will settle near a brisk twenty, and winds will pick up, bringing a bolder chill with gusts that remind us to bundle up. A warm jacket, perhaps layered over a cozy sweater, would serve well, while a hat could shield you from the draft as you navigate the early evening. One might find pleasure in a nearby caf\u00e9, sipping something warm and savoring the soft whir of conversation, all while keeping an eye on the horizon for fleeting winter clouds that might combine rain and snow, painting a fleeting wintry picture against the skyline.",
