    "weather_report": "As the night draws on in Boston, serenity blankets the city, punctuated only by the twinkling lights that flicker like distant stars. The air, crisp and still, carries with it a chill that hints at the chillier moments yet to come. With temperatures settling around 14 degrees, a gentle northwest wind stirs the silence, whispering reminders of winter\u2019s lingering presence.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the promise of a radiant Saturday emerges. Clear skies will unveil themselves, allowing the sun to warm the day to a comfortable 36 degrees. The west wind, though light, adds a playful note with its occasional gusts. This is a day that beckons for a leisurely stroll through historic streets, perhaps stopping by a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm beverage that staves off the cold. The ambiance invites layers; a well-fitted coat, a snug scarf, and perhaps a pair of gloves will serve you well against the winter bite. Embrace the outdoors, whether wandering through a park or visiting a local market, as the clarity of the day offers an invigorating escape from the confines of home.",
