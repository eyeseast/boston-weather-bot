    "weather_report": "In Boston today, a gentle haze cloaks the morning sky, hinting at the upcoming transitions of the day. Scattered rain showers paint a scene of muted grays before 10 AM, while the air is filled with a touch of humidity that mingles pleasantly with the faint hints of warmth. As the day unfolds, patchy fog is expected to drift in and out, wrapping the city in its soft embrace. With a high nearly reaching 75, it\u2019s a temperate day that invites you to wander, although perhaps not too far from an umbrella.\n\nAs evening approaches, the promise of more scattered rain showers remains, giving way to the possibility of thunderstorms that might rumble gently, echoing the whispers of approaching summer nights. Dress comfortably in light layers, as the warmth beckons but a sudden coolness may rustle through the air. A leisurely stroll along the waterfront could bring moments of introspection, while a quiet corner in a caf\u00e9 offers a peaceful retreat from the fleeting rain. In this embrace of summer\u2019s softness, one might even savor a book or engage in reflective musings, each minute stretching out like the lingering twilight.",
