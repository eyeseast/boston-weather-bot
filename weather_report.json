    "weather_report": "As the night lingers over Boston, the air carries a hint of moisture, a whisper of a passing shower anticipated between the quiet hours of three and five. The temperature rests gently around the chill of thirty-seven degrees, accompanied by a soft southwest breeze that occasionally stirs the stillness. It's a tranquil moment, the city draped in darkness, with the glow of distant lights casting a warm shimmer against the cold canvas of the night.\n\nWith dawn's arrival, the day promises to unfurl partly sunny, a welcome embrace for those who venture out. Expect a high near fifty-eight, where the fresh west wind, brisk and spirited, may gust as high as twenty-six miles an hour, adding a hint of excitement to the otherwise calm atmosphere. This splendid weather invites you to don layers\u2014a light jacket over a cozy sweater, perhaps, along with sturdy footwear for a stroll through the awakening streets. With the sun peeking through, it\u2019s an opportune moment to enjoy the simple pleasures: a leisurely coffee on a park bench, watching as nature stirs to life, or exploring the quiet charm of a neighborhood market. The day beckons with the promise of warmth and light, cracked open gently, as the city moves from shadows into vivid color.",
