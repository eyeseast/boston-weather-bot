The temperature, resting at a cutting 8 degrees, feels even more biting with the wind chill plummeting to an almost oppressive -5. The steady north wind carries with it a briskness that compels residents to tuck their chins deeper into warm scarves. Though the forecast hints at a slight chance of snow, both the heavens and the earth seem to hold their breath, presenting a predominantly overcast canvas punctuated occasionally by glimpses of distant city lights.\n\nAs Sunday unfurls its wings, it will greet us with a slightly warmer embrace, presenting a high hovering near 24. Yet, as the wind reasserts its playful dominance, chills will still nip at exposed skin, recalling the relentless beauty of winter. For those brave hearts compelled to venture outside, layers will be your ally\u2014a thermal base under a cozy sweater, topped with a sturdy coat, wool gloves, and a perhaps an incongruously bright hat to counter the drab palette of the day. \n\nThis day, marked by a muted sky and soft stillness, invites one to sip hot coffee from a favorite spot while gazing at the quaint corners of the neighborhood. Or, perhaps, a leisurely stroll through the well-trodden paths of the Common will reveal the hidden charms of a winter landscape. As snowflakes flutter, one can revel in the simple pleasure of the serene, wintry air, appreciating the solitude that blankets the city.",
