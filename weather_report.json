    "weather_report": "As night drapes over Boston, the air carries an anticipatory charge, hinting at the possibility of light showers and perhaps even a rumble of thunder before dawn. The clouds linger like discreet whispers, thickening the darkness that now envelops the city, cradling the skyline in a soft, murky embrace. The temperature hovers comfortably, inviting moments of reflection on the day past while a gentle breeze stirs, rustling through trees and carrying the faint scent of rain. \n\nThe upcoming day promises a refreshing break as sunlight peers through, with a delightful warmth anticipated by afternoon. As the north winds whisper their way through the city, carrying a sense of renewal, clothing that balances lightness with just enough protection for early morning chill would be wise. A light sweater or a jacket\u2014something easily shed as the day warms\u2014is in order. As the hours unfurl, a leisurely walk along the riverbank or a stop at a quaint caf\u00e9 feels just right, each moment an invitation to embrace the simple joys that this weather conjures.",
