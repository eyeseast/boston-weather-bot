    "weather_report": "As night envelops Boston, the air is thick with the promise of rain, progressively nudging the city into a damp embrace. Dark clouds hang heavy above, charged with the anticipation of a downpour that seemingly whispers to the trees and streets. The low temperature hints at a chill that penetrates clothing but is coupled with the rising warmth of the evening. Winds stir gently, carrying the earthy scent of impending rainfall, a reminder of nature's rhythms.\n\nAs tomorrow dawns, expect a transition as the rain surrenders to the sun, revealing a fragile warmth beneath the clouds. The day holds a playful mix of sun and scattered clouds, inviting a chance to step into the beauty beyond your door. Given the lingering chill in the air, layering is wise; perhaps a comfortable light jacket over a soft sweater and sturdy shoes would serve you well should you find yourself outdoors. Whether it\u2019s a brisk walk along the harbor or a quiet moment with a book at a cozy caf\u00e9, the city invites you to experience its charm amidst the delicate interplay of weather.",
