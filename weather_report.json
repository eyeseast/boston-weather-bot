    "weather_report": "As dusk blankets Boston, a gentle cloak of mist begins to settle over the region, hinting at the patchy fog that will gather in the hours to come. The night promises a certain stillness, punctuated by the occasional whisper of rain\u2014a light, fleeting presence that mingles with the warmth lingering in the air. With temperatures embracing a comfortable 65 degrees, the south wind, soft and unhurried, drifts slowly across the streets, carrying with it the promise of the day ahead.\n\nTomorrow unfolds with possibilities, as the dawn greets the city with a mix of clouds and the chance of sporadic rain showers. Early risers may witness the veil of fog cling to the horizon until the warm embrace of the sun pierces through, inviting brightness into the day. As the sun climbs, a high near 82 beckons, urging residents to shed any heavy layers in favor of light, breathable clothing. Those who venture outdoors might consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the ambient sounds of the city meet the aroma of fresh brews. Given the intermittent chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the afternoon, an umbrella could serve as a faithful companion, shielding one from the whims of nature while embracing the serenity of urban life.",
