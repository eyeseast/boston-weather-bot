As the afternoon unfolds, the whisper of rain might tease the air, floating in around 1 PM\u2014a fitting accompaniment to the day\u2019s partly sunny disposition. Tonight, anticipate a mild retreat into partly cloudy skies, dipping down to around 33 degrees, while the chance of rain lingers slightly before 9 PM, a reminder of nature's unpredictability.\n\nAs you venture outdoors in this delicate balance between coolness and potential rain, consider layering your attire\u2014perhaps a light jacket paired with long sleeves is most prudent, offering comfort against the chill while being prepared for the possibility of a damp evening. While the forecast may hint at wetness, the allure of the day still beckons. A leisurely stroll through nearby gardens or a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9, embracing the warmth of a hot beverage as clouds amble above, could provide a peaceful respite from the mundane.
