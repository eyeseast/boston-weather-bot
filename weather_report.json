    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Boston, a delicate light spills into the city, hinting at a gentle warmth to come, even as the air retains a crispness that speaks of winter's lingering touch. Today promises to be partly sunny, with skies painted in soft hues of blue, while the swaying branches comfortably accommodate the light southwest wind. The forecast hints at a high approaching frosty 34 degrees, a temperature that, while brisk, invites layers rather than bulk; a cozy sweater under a tailored coat would strike a fine balance, allowing for both mobility and warmth during the day\u2019s outings.\n\nAs the sun begins its ascent, venture forth to enjoy the undeniable charm of late winter in the city. Perhaps a quiet stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely stop at a cozy caf\u00e9 with a view of the Charles River will suffice. With the evening inching towards colder temperatures, the clouds will gather, inviting a comfortable wrap and a warm drink to ease into the night. The invitation of the city will be alive, beckoning with the promise of pleasant exploration among its resplendent streets; each step an embrace of the winter day that is gently unfolding.",
