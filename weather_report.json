    "weather_report": "The morning in Boston greets us with a thick veil of fog, cloaking the surroundings in a muted gray. Snow flurries are anticipated, swirling gently before noon, adding a whisper of winter's chill to the already damp atmosphere. As the day stretches on, the skies will remain overcast, with a high of about 36 degrees. The faint echo of a southern breeze gives a slight warmth to the air, but the presence of cloud cover and a hefty chance of precipitation renders any outdoor plans a touch precarious. \n\nAs evening approaches, expect a continuation of the wintry mix. Patchy fog will embrace the city, possibly playing a gentle game with rain and snow, only to hint at a slight chance of freezing rain in the early morning hours. With temperatures dipping to around 30, warmth will be essential. Layering becomes a necessity\u2014donning a cozy sweater under a waterproof jacket, along with sturdy boots to navigate the slush. The day may not offer the most inviting conditions for sauntering outdoors, but perhaps a quiet afternoon at a local caf\u00e9, sipping warm beverages and indulging in a good book, could be the perfect remedy to counter the dreariness of the weather.",
