    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches in Boston, the sky hangs low with an impenetrable veil of fog. The air carries a fresh chill, a reminder of lingering winter, with temperatures settling into the low 40s. The world outside remains wrapped in a shroud, muted sounds and distant shapes contributing to a quiet anticipation. There is a certain stillness that invites contemplation\u2014perfect for a solitary stroll along the river, where the soft whispers of nature speak volumes. The fog, while obscuring the sights, adds a poetic quality to the morning.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect this ethereal fog to gradually dissipate, giving way to a gray and cloudy expanse. A gentle warmth will settle in, hinting at the day's promise of near 67 degrees. While a few scattered rain showers may threaten late afternoon plans, they'll likely be brief. This is a time to layer comfortably\u2014a light jacket will serve you well, paired with sturdy shoes for potential puddles. With the weather nudging toward spring, consider a leisurely visit to a neighborhood caf\u00e9 or a stroll through a park, absorbing the essence of two seasons in harmony. As you venture out, remember that even the murkiest of mornings can give rise to unexpected beauty.",
