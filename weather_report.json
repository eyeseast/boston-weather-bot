    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Boston, a cool breeze dances through the streets, carrying the unmistakable crispness that heralds the onset of late autumn. The temperature is gently dipping towards 39 degrees, while the western winds, bold at 14 to 17 mph, seem to weave a tapestry of shifting shadows around the city's skyline. The sky, partly cloaked by whispers of clouds, casts a mild yet contemplative mood, perfect for those seeking solace after a long day. There\u2019s a definite chill in the air, urging residents to wrap themselves in warmth\u2014perhaps a sturdy jacket or a favorite scarf to guard against the brisk gusts.\n\nLooking ahead, Sunday promises a brighter disposition as the sun takes center stage, chasing away the remnants of the night's chill. With a high near 50, it's an ideal canvas for a day outdoors, perhaps exploring the Boston Common or savoring a leisurely stroll along the Charles River. The winds may remain a dynamic companion, gusting up to 36 mph, yet they carry with them the invigorating essence of the season, inviting the adventurous spirit to step outside. Given the day's splendid potential and the early dusk that accompanies this November night, it might be a fine time to enjoy a quiet walk, entwined in the soft glow of street lights, amidst the quiet audience of nature.",
