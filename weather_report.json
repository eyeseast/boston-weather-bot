    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the atmosphere seems to sigh under the weight of heavy clouds, promising rain that has arrived with an unyielding urgency. The looming specter of thunderstorms adds a touch of intensity, with brief moments that could unleash the day\u2019s pent-up moisture, drenching the streets and soaking the earth. As the winds whisper at a steady clip, the chill hangs in the air, pushing the temperature down towards a cool embrace. It\u2019s a day that calls for sturdy footwear and a waterproof jacket\u2014essentials that will shield you from the encroaching dampness and bracing gusts.\n\nAs the rain persists into the evening, it brings with it a thick fog that shrouds the familiar skyline, obscuring landmarks and lending an air of mystery to the surroundings. The pounding rain and soft rumble of distant thunder might tempt you to nestle indoors, perhaps wrapped in a cozy blanket with a good book or indulging in a moment of reflection. Should you feel adventurous, a brief stroll through the dampened streets could reveal a solitary beauty in the glistening surfaces and muted sounds of the city, a gentle reminder that even the grayest days can unveil hidden allure.",
