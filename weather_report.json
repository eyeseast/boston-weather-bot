    "weather_report": "As the clock strikes twelve on this mid-June night in Boston, a gentle hush blankets the city, the streets shimmering faintly under the soft glow of distant lights. Clouds hang low in the sky, their presence whispering of moisture in the air, yet the coolness that captures the evening is inviting rather than forbidding. The northeast wind meanders lazily, hinting at a calm as it sweeps through the alleys and avenues, infusing the atmosphere with a refreshing touch as the temperature clings to a comfortable 54 degrees.\n\nTomorrow, Boston will awaken to an embrace of sunshine, promising to wash away the night\u2019s overcast weariness. As the sun rises, it will cast a warm glow across the landscape, drawing out vibrant greens and the cheerful petals of early summer blooms. With temperatures expected to dance near 68 degrees, the day will invite both leisurely strolls along the Esplanade and cherished moments spent in quaint caf\u00e9s, where conversations can flow as freely as the coffee. Dress lightly but keep a light shawl or jacket handy; the cool morning may want to linger, but the afternoon sun will coax the warmth to its peak gently.\n\nOn this splendid Sunday, consider meandering through the Boston Public Garden, perhaps treating yourself to an afternoon of reading beneath a sprawling oak, or enjoy a peaceful moment with a book on a park bench as laughter and joy weave through the air. Alternatively, a visit to a local farmer's market might entice, where fresh produce and artisanal goods await, ready to inspire a delicious meal at home. It\u2019s a day made for simple pleasures, with summer on the horizon, promising joy wrapped in the tender arms of a gentle breeze.",
