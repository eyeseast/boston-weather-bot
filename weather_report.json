    "weather_report": "As the early morning hours settle over Boston, the city is cloaked in a gentle quiet, the peace only occasionally punctuated by the distant hum of life waking up. The skies are mostly clear, an expanse of soft navy stretched overhead, awaiting the embrace of daylight. In this serene atmosphere, the temperature rests coolly at around fifty-one degrees, with a whisper of a westward breeze stirring lazily through the air.\n\nAs the sun climbs, it promises a day kissed by warmth, with temperatures nudging toward seventy-eight. There is something invigorating about such a clear and sunny day, where the light can dance off the surfaces of buildings and the subtle rhythm of life flows with ease. Those venturing outdoors might find comfort in layers\u2014a light sweater or long sleeves for the cool morning, transitioning gracefully to something lighter as midday approaches. It\u2019s the perfect opportunity to wander through the city's many parks or to enjoy a stroll along the waterfront, where the harmony of nature and urban life collides splendidly. A simple coffee in hand, perhaps, could add an aromatic touch to the day, complementing the mildness that Boston offers as it awakens from its slumber.",
