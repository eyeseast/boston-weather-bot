    "weather_report": "Gray clouds drape the Boston skyline like a heavy, damp cloak, reflecting the day\u2019s somber mood. Rain, steady and relentless, blankets the city, softening the sounds of bustling streets and muffling the usual clamor of life. The chill lingers, urging passersby to wrap themselves in layers, perhaps opting for a waterproof jacket and sturdy footwear, essentials for navigating the puddled sidewalks. It\u2019s a day to seek shelter, where the warmth of a coffee shop or the cozy corners of a bookstore beckon, inviting you to lose yourself in a good read or share quiet conversations with friends.\n\nAs evening approaches, the weather will shift subtly, introducing the all-too-predictable dance of rain and snow. The sky will remain stubbornly overcast, casting a monochrome filter over the landscape, where sporadic flurries may add a touch of whimsy to the dreary backdrop. With temperatures dipping into the low twenties, the chill will bite; a good hat and gloves will be indispensable for any evening excursions. Consider fending off the gloom by immersing in a warm meal, perhaps in a quaint restaurant where the morning's rain transforms into a romantic backdrop, with rain tapping softly against the windows, inviting a moment of tranquil solace amid the storm.",
