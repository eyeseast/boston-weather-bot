    "weather_report": "As Boston awakes to a clear, sun-drenched morning, the chill lingers just enough to remind us of the season. With a high near forty-three, the day feels bright and inviting, though a brisk northwest wind nudges you to layer up. Despite the sunny disposition above, the shifting conditions of the evening carry a whisper of surprise, bringing forth patches of fog\u2014some that may freeze\u2014turning the air soft and ethereal as the hours deepen into night. \n\nAs you step outside, a simple scarf and a warm coat will serve well against the playful chill. Today is perfect for a leisurely stroll through the streets or perhaps a visit to a charming caf\u00e9, where one can linger over a steaming cup of coffee, watching the world bustle around. The anticipated fog in the evening beckons a touch of mystery, a perfect backdrop for a relaxed evening, where stories shared under a softened sky can bring warmth to even the coldest winter night. Enjoy the day\u2019s clarity before the fog envelops you, and let the beauty of Boston wrap you in its embrace.",
