    "weather_report": "As the clock creeps toward midnight, Boston is enveloped in a heavy cloak of impending snow, a quiet invitation for those seeking the comfort of home\u2019s embrace. The air carries a crisp chill, settling in at around 21 degrees, as the northwest wind subtly rustles the branches. Tonight heralds a steady promise of snowfall, with precipitation virtually assured, thickening clouds disguising the night sky, and transforming familiar streets into a serene white wonderland. \n\nTomorrow unfolds with the same muted tones, where the flurries will continue, and the temperature will dip further, offering a perfect setting for warm coats and snug scarves. As the snowfall accumulates, potentially layering three to five inches, one might find solace in warming drinks or the gentle companionship of a good book by the firelight. Adventurous souls could seize the day for a brisk walk, savoring the beauty of freshly fallen snow, though it\u2019s wise to bundle up against the brisk winds that may whip through in gusts. While the roads are likely to be less inviting, embracing the tranquility of home may just be the most rewarding pursuit on such a night.",
