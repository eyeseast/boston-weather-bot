    "weather_report": "As the quiet night drapes itself over Boston, the air carries a crisp chill reminiscent of a deep winter\u2019s embrace, with temperatures resting comfortably around 22 degrees. A gentle west wind dances through the streets, carrying with it the faintest whispers of the bustling city. This calm yet invigorating atmosphere heralds the dawn, promising a pleasant Sunday to those who venture outside. \n\nWith the sun poised to rise, it will gradually illuminate the skyline, revealing a day adorned in patches of bright blue and soft white clouds, a canvas at the mercy of a gentle breeze, with gusts that may tease but rarely disturb. Expect highs reaching around 31 degrees, making this a fine occasion for layering \u2013 perhaps a cozy sweater beneath a sturdy jacket, coupled with a light scarf to shield against the swift winds. \n\nAs the day unfolds, consider embracing simple joys: a stroll along the Charles River to bask in the sunlight filtering through the trees, or perhaps exploring the lesser-traveled paths of the Back Bay. Such mundane yet delightful pursuits can transform an ordinary day into a treasure trove of experiences beneath a clear winter sky, breathing in the brisk air that invigorates the spirit.",
