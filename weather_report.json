    "weather_report": "In Boston, the early hours reveal an atmosphere colored by the cool embrace of an approaching dawn. The night begins to yield its hold, offering a mostly clear view of the city, although the chill lingers in the air like an old acquaintance reluctant to leave. As the temperature edges toward 40, the northern winds whisper their secrets at 8 mph, occasionally punctuated by exhilarating gusts. If you venture outside, a light jacket will serve as a comforting shield against the cool breeze.\n\nAs the sun rises, the day promises a gentle warmth beneath a mostly sunny disposition. The forecast holds a high near 45, perfect for a stroll through the quiet streets or perhaps a visit to a nearby caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee invites warmth not just to the hands, but to the soul. Those heading out might consider a cozy sweater under a coat, allowing for easy adjustments as the day unfolds. The accompanying wind will remind you of nature\u2019s capriciousness, so a scarf might keep the chill at bay while harmonizing with the approach of the sunny hours. The day offers a serene canvas perfect for converging with the rhythms of daily life; taking a leisurely walk in one of the city parks, where frost-kissed grass glimmers in the morning light, feels particularly fitting in such a refreshing atmosphere.",
