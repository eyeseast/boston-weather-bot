With the air crisp and clear, it whispers promises of a softly-lit morning, as temperatures hover gently around the chill of thirty-seven degrees. As dawn approaches, a glorious day unfurls ahead, beckoning forth the radiant sunshine that will warm the streets and soften the edges of winter\u2019s lingering embrace.\n\nTuesday will greet you with expansive blue skies and temperatures rising to the inviting heights of sixty-three. A pleasant south wind will dance through the day, carrying with it a gentle warmth and an occasional gust that might playfully tussle your hair as you stroll along the Charles River or explore the cobblestone streets. Dress in layers; a light sweater over a collared shirt will serve you well, providing ease as you transition from the brisk morning to the mild afternoon. Seek out a charming caf\u00e9 or perhaps the artful confines of a gallery to savor the day\u2019s offerings\u2014a warm cup of coffee or the vibrant strokes of local artwork against a sunny backdrop. Boston awaits your footsteps in this picture-perfect unfolding of early spring.",
