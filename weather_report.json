    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds in Boston, the landscape is painted in a muted palette of gray, a soft reminder of spring's hesitance to fully embrace warmth. The clouds hang low, creating a gentle overcast that cloaks the city in a kind of tranquil stillness. The air carries a hint of moisture, and though the day begins without the promise of sun, there remains a whisper of a potential afternoon shower, possibly bringing a cleansing freshness around noon. With temperatures expected to rise to a respectable 64 degrees, the coolness in the air can be a welcoming embrace, particularly for those stepping outside.\n\nYet this day invites a certain pleasure in the mundane: a perfect time for a leisurely stroll through the cobblestone streets, wrapped in a light jacket, as the soft winds rustle through the trees lining the avenues. The occasional sprinkle may blur the distinction between sidewalk and sky, but it only adds to the charm of the moment. Perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 is in order, where the warmth of freshly brewed coffee can revive spirits against the cool backdrop; a place to watch the world pass by as connections are made in whispered tones. As the evening approaches, gathering clouds will continue to blanket the city, ushering in a night that feels invitingly snug. In dressing for the day, layers are advised, providing both comfort and flexibility, allowing one to adapt to the gentle rhythms of Boston under its cloud-soft sky.",
