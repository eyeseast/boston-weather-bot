    "weather_report": "As the clock brushes past noon in Boston, a veil of thick clouds drapes the afternoon, ushering in a swell of humidity and the scent of impending rain. With patches of fog weaving through the skyline and scattered showers expected to dance between 2 PM and 5 PM, the day promises an enveloping moodiness that may inspire both introspection and creativity. The high temperature meanders around a comfortable 71, which invites a light sweater or a soft, breathable layer. A gentle southeast breeze whispers through the streets, but the humidity whispers back, thickening the air with a hint of tropical warmth.\n\nAs evening approaches, the fog will linger, continuing the trend of scattered rain showers until the late hours. The clouds will clutch tightly to the city, granting a low of about 64, perfect for cozying up with a warm beverage while contemplating a stroll through the dimly lit parks or a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 filled with the aroma of fresh-brewed coffee. If one dares to venture out, a light waterproof jacket would offer some comfort against the lingering dampness and surprise showers. With such conditions looming, perhaps it's best to embrace the calm, reflective nature of the day, allowing the soft glow of a lamp and the pages of an enthralling book to be the evening's guiding light.",
