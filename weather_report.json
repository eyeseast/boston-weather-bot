    "weather_report": "As night enfolds Boston, the air carries a bittersweet edge, the kind of dusk that reminds you of fleeting moments\u2014perhaps a hint of rain brushed past earlier, now retreating into memories. Patchy clouds thread the sky, illuminating the scene with delicate wisps of uncertain light. The temperature lingers at a cool 33 degrees, an invitation to embrace something warm and cozy. A gentle west wind dances lightly about, whispering through the darkened streets, hinting at the promise of a clearer day ahead.\n\nAs the sun rises tomorrow, so too does the allure of a sunny aura that promises to warm the soul with its golden embrace. The anticipated high of 49 will greet those who venture outside, encouraging a light jacket or a snug scarf to ward off morning chills. Delightfully, it will be a day well-suited for roaming the city, perhaps exploring the quieter corners of Boston's parks or enjoying a coffee at a quaint sidewalk caf\u00e9, soaking in the calm before the bustle of a new season. Emboldened by the clarity of the day, this is a moment to cherish, where each breath of crisp air becomes a taste of renewal.",
