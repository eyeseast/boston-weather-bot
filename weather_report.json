    "weather_report": "As twilight deepens over Boston, a gentle shroud of patchy fog begins to weave through the city\u2019s streets, cloaked beneath clouds that hang low in the starlit sky. The warmth of the evening settles in, the temperature hovering lightly around 67 degrees, accompanied by a soft, whispering breeze from the south. Here, in the stillness of this sultry summer night, the atmosphere feels both tranquil and inviting, offering a hint of what the day ahead may bring.\n\nWith morning on the horizon, expect the fog to linger just a while longer, before being lifted by the rising sun. The day promises warmth, peeking toward 84 degrees under layers of predominantly cloudy skies, with a possibility of afternoon showers and thunder that might rattle you from a leisurely afternoon reverie. Dress in lightweight layers\u2014perhaps a comfortable T-shirt and breathable pants\u2014ready to embrace the sweltering warmth while being equipped for those unexpected raindrops. As the day unfolds, why not amble through one of Boston's charming neighborhoods, stop by a local caf\u00e9 for a morning brew, or enjoy a stroll along the waterfront? The air, fragrant with sea breezes and faint hints of impending rain, invites exploration but also offers a moment to pause in quiet contemplation.",
