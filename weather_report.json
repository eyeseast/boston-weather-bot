    "weather_report": "In the dim hours of the night, Boston finds itself shrouded in a damp embrace, where the rain gently taps against window panes, and the air is heavy with the promise of a storm. With temperatures lingering in the low 40s, a gradual rise is expected as the night progresses, suggesting that the chill will release its grip, only briefly, before dawn ushers in a cooler, but still overcast, morning. The winds whisper and sway, dancing at 8 to 12 mph, rustling the branches as they carry with them the scent of rain-soaked earth, making an evening stroll under an umbrella particularly atmospheric, albeit slightly soggy.\n\nAs Tuesday unfolds, hints of sun break through the clouds, striving against the remnants of the early rainfall. The high will struggle near 52, a fair respite from the spring chill. The northwest winds will continue their spirited play, adding briskness to the air. In light of these conditions, a layered approach to dressing is wise; a snug sweater works beautifully beneath a light jacket, complemented by waterproof footwear to navigate any lingering puddles. Given the hint of sunniness peeking through, a leisurely morning at a caf\u00e9, watching the world wake up while savoring a warm beverage, feels just right. Later, a gentle walk through the park could paint the day with moments of quiet contemplation, as the city begins to dry out and breathe, preparing to greet the season with open arms.",
