    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, the remnants of yesterday\u2019s rains linger in the air, casting a shroud of mist that softens the contours of the city. Rain has painted the streets a glossy black, while a chill drapes itself over the landscape, making the world feel hushed and contemplative. Although the clock reads three, the fog still whispers secrets, wrapping around buildings and blurring the edges of reality. Today, however, promises a shift. Once the sun rises and dispels the fog, a gentle warmth will greet the city, with a high near 42, inviting those with a taste for crisp air to step outside.\n\nAs the morning unfolds, expect the clouds to gradually give way to the sun, crafting a much more pleasant canvas for the day. It's an ideal time for layered clothing; a sturdy jacket, perhaps, layered over a soft sweater will provide just the right insulation as the brisk winds brush against you. While the weather may seem dreary at first, the afternoon brings a brighter atmosphere, perfect for a stroll along the Charles, where the reflections of the trees and the distant glow of the skyline will create a serene backdrop. A simple errand, a leisurely walk, or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 to savor a warm drink feels particularly apt today, allowing the invigorating chill to awaken your senses while the sun slowly weaves joy into the fabric of the day.",
