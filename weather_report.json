    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Boston unfolds under a canvas of clear blue, an invitation to bask in the gentle warmth of the sun reaching towards a high that dances near 47 degrees. The air is crisp, enlivened by a light westward breeze that whispers through the streets, beckoning you to step outdoors. Tonight promises a serene transition, as the sky remains mostly clear, ushering in cooler tones closer to 28 degrees, perfect for evening strolls under the starlit heavens.\n\nIn these refreshing conditions, a cozy yet light ensemble \u2013 perhaps a snug sweater layered beneath a classic jacket \u2013 will keep you comfortable against the chill as the sun dips below the horizon. As the afternoon wanes, why not wander through one of Boston's charming neighborhoods? Take a moment to explore the tranquil pathways of the Public Garden or to savor a quiet cup of coffee at a nearby caf\u00e9. One might even bring along a book, letting the soothing ambiance wash over you. The day invites a slower pace, rewarding those who seize the moment with beauty and tranquility.",
