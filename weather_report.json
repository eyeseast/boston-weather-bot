    "weather_report": "In Boston this afternoon, the sky wears a muted palette as the sun pokes through wispy clouds, casting a gentle warmth over the city. A brisk southwest breeze stirs the crispness in the air, encouraging a midday stroll along the Charles River or a quiet pause at a quaint caf\u00e9. The temperature hovers comfortably near 46 degrees, a welcome respite for those who haven\u2019t yet tucked away their outerwear. As daylight wanes, the clouds will thicken, turning the evening into a mostly cloudy tableau, with temperatures dipping to around 37. \n\nWith these shifting conditions, layering becomes essential. A light sweater or a smart jacket will serve well against the evening chill, perhaps paired with a warm scarf to ward off the cool west wind that will accompany the transition into night. As dusk approaches, one might find joy in visiting a nearby bookshop, losing oneself in the pages of literature, or savoring the last moments of daylight from a cozy corner of a favorite pub. The choices are comforting and simple, perfect for embracing the seasonal change in this historic city.",
