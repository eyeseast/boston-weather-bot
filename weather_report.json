    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds in Boston, a blanket of muted clouds cloaks the city, with only the distant twinkle of lights breaking through the darkness. The air carries a crisp chill, hinting at the fleeting winter wonders that tomorrow may bring. Tonight\u2019s forecast raises the slightest chance of snow after the witching hour, an ephemeral whisper of white against the night. The wind whispers from the west, gentle and persistent, carrying with it both a bite and a promise.\n\nAs dawn creeps into Sunday, an invitation emerges for snowflakes to dance briefly before fading into the clearer embrace of day. With the sun's tentative rays, Boston may shake off the wintry chill to reveal a partly sunny sky, though the moment is best approached with warm layers\u2014perhaps a sturdy coat, a knit scarf, and gloves to ward off the morning's bite. The city will awaken, urging you to explore its cafes or stroll through parks, where the promise of snowflakes may still tease the edges of a quiet morning. A day like this beckons for a hot cup of cocoa, a book in a cozy nook, or a leisurely walk to embrace the crisp air while indulging in the understated beauty of a New England winter.",
