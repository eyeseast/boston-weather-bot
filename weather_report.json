    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, a gentle warmth envelops the city, with rays of sunlight filtering through a veil of soft clouds. The temperature hovers comfortably in the upper 70s, inviting residents to step outside and savor the day. A light breeze carries hints of the nearby ocean, tickling the skin with a refreshing touch. However, as the sun dips lower in the sky, the atmosphere begins to shift; the forecast whispers of rain showers arriving after midnight, suggesting a blanket of clouds will drape over the horizon as you prepare for evening. \n\nFor those contemplating a stroll or an errand in the late afternoon, light layers would be wise, as the temperatures will soon fall into the 50s. Perhaps a relaxed walk along the Charles River, where the waters reflect the fragmented beauty of the skies, or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 will offer solace before the rain arrives. Embrace the simplicity of the moment\u2014there\u2019s a quiet charm in a cup of coffee while watching the clouds gather, a precursor to the gentle rhythm of rain that will soon serenade the city.",
