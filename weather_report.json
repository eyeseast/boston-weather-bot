    "weather_report": "As the clock strikes midnight over Boston, a veil of fog rests over the city, lending an almost ethereal quality to the night. The air feels damp, whispering of the potential for rain, and one might catch a chill that suggests the promise of frail flakes of snow by dawn. The grey clouds, heavy with moisture, loom above, while a light northern wind carries a trace of coolness. Such conditions invite contemplation, perfect for curling up with a book or perhaps enjoying the stillness of a quiet evening indoors.\n\nFor Tuesday, the morning may greet early risers with the residual fog and a slight chance of those elusive snow showers. As the day unfolds, expect the clouds to remain a constant companion, though a shift towards rain is beckoning by late morning. The high will flirt with the low forties, giving the air a crisp edge as gusty winds will swirl about, reminding one that winter is reluctant to leave just yet. A layered approach to dressing will serve well today\u2014think cozy sweaters beneath a sturdy jacket, paired with warm boots, a stylish scarf, and perhaps a hat to ward off the chill. This atmospheric day could inspire a leisurely stroll through a quiet neighborhood or an exploration of one of the city\u2019s tucked-away cafes, where the warmth of a hot drink might combat the damp and dreariness that envelops the streets.",
