    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Boston, a thick blanket of cloud looms overhead, hinting at a moodily subdued atmosphere. While the thermometer edges toward a modest warmth, the sky's grey hue casts a gentle pall over the city, merging with the faint promise of rain. A light southeast breeze stirs, carrying whispers of the showers that may soon grace the pavement. As daylight wanes, the clouds will likely deepen, ushering in areas of fog that will soften the edges of familiar landscapes, transforming the world into something more ethereal.\n\nAs evening approaches, anticipate the gentle patter of rain against windows, creating a soothing backdrop to the night's quiet activities. With the temperature dipping towards a cooler 50 degrees, it is advisable to don layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater beneath a water-repellent jacket and sensible shoes for those brave enough to venture outside. The evening air, draped in mist, might call for a leisurely stroll down tree-lined streets or a cozy retreat to a beloved caf\u00e9, where the aroma of coffee mingles with the warmth of conversation. Indulging in a good book or savoring the ambiance of the night could be the perfect antidote to this serene yet somber setting, capturing the essence of a rainy evening in Boston.",
