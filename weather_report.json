As night approaches, anticipation builds\u2014a chance of freezing rain looms, casting a veil of uncertainty over the evening. With a low settling around 31 and an 80% chance of precipitation, the air feels laden with the promise of a damp and slippery night. \n\nIn such conditions, it is wise to dress warmly\u2014perhaps a snug woolen scarf wrapped close, layered under a coat that can withstand the dampness.
