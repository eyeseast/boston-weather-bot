    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, a gentle veil of fog embraces the city, mingling with the distant whispers of rain. The atmosphere is laden with moisture, presenting a landscape both serene and enigmatic. Visibility is muted, a soft blur that adds a layer of introspection to the morning stroll. The comfort of a light jacket would serve well against the coolness settling in, while a closed umbrella might be prudent for those venturing out, given the ever-so-slight chance of rain that teases the horizon. \n\nAs the day unfolds, expect a similar tableau; the sky remains predominantly cloudy, yet there is an underlying warmth just shy of 70 degrees, promising moments when the sun\u2019s elusive rays may grace the day. Activities could include a tranquil visit to a local caf\u00e9 where the foghorns of the harbor are a charming backdrop for reflections on the gentle ebb and flow of city life. Alternatively, a leisurely walk through a nearby park could provide solace, where even in the muted light, the budding spring flowers might hint at their vivid colors, waiting patiently to burst into bloom.",
