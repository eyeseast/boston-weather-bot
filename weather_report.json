    "weather_report": "As the night drapes Boston in a cloak of calm, the unassuming glow of city lights flickers in the distance, a gentle map of human endeavor against the ink-black canvas of the sky. With temperatures dipping to a crisp 30 degrees, you might feel the coolness nipping at your cheeks. The air feels dry and fresh, brushing past with a soft whisper from the southwest, stirring the stillness of the evening. \n\nTomorrow promises a daylight that will unfold upon the city like a well-written novel, marked by a reassuring brightness. The sun will rise higher, bringing with it a hint of warmth that stirs the promise of a pleasant day. With highs flirting around 42 degrees, the winds will dance enthusiastically, gusting up to 37 mph, urging you to don layers that balance comfort and style. A light jacket, perhaps, with a sturdy scarf to ward off the chill as you stroll through Boston's timeworn streets or linger over a mug of coffee at a favorite cafe. Tomorrow\u2019s weather beckons outdoor lovers, ideal for a brisk walk along the Charles River or a visit to the local bookstore, where you can lose yourself in pages while the world unfurls beneath the sun.",
