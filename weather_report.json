    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks toward the early hours in Boston, a soft veil of patchy fog embraces the city, lending a quiet mystery to the night. The air feels mild, with a gentle breeze that carries the faint scent of damp earth, hinting at the fleeting warmth of summer still lingering against the whispers of autumn. Those who rise before dawn may find themselves enveloped in this fleeting blanket of fog, but come morning, the sun will soon reject the fog\u2019s embrace, giving way to a day that promises clarity and warmth.\n\nTuesday dawns brightly with the fog receding and a vast canvas of blue spreading overhead. As the sun rises higher, it will cast a gentle glow on the fa\u00e7ades of Boston\u2019s historic buildings, inviting the world outside to enjoy the pleasant temperatures that hover around the low seventies. A light northeast breeze will accompany the sunshine, making it the perfect backdrop for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River or a quiet visit to one of the city's lush parks. Dressing in layers would be wise \u2013 a light sweater or long sleeves for the morning chill will transition seamlessly to short sleeves as the day progresses. Embrace the intimacy of this modest September day; perhaps find a charming caf\u00e9 to enjoy a warm cup of coffee or a light pastry, or take a moment to visit a bookstore, losing yourself in the pages as the sunlight spills gently through the windows.",
