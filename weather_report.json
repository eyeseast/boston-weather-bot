    "weather_report": "A tranquil morning envelops Boston, where the sunlight pours down from a clear blue sky, illuminating the fa\u00e7ades of brick and granite that define the city\u2019s historic charm. The temperature lends itself to a brisk feel, lingering around the mid-fifties, as a gentle northeast breeze whispers through the streets. This sunny interlude, however, is destined to give way, as twilight approaches and the possibility of drizzle creeps in after supper, with a soft veil of fog expected to descend upon the city, transforming its silhouette into something more ethereal.\n\nAs day transitions to night, consider dressing in layers\u2014perhaps donning a light sweater under a windbreaker to embrace the changing conditions. As the sun sinks low and you venture out for the evening, a casual walk along the Charles River or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 might be the best way to savor this fleeting moment before the clouds roll in. The slight chance of drizzle provides the perfect excuse to indulge in simple pleasures, perhaps sampling a warm pastry or diving into a good book as the city prepares to cocoon itself in the comforting haze of night.",
