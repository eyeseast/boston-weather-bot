The air is cool and laced with moisture, a reminder that winter casts its long shadow over the city. As the night slips slowly into early morning, temperatures are set to rise gently, luring the remnants of the chill away. The promise of rain is etched in the atmosphere, a steadfast 100% chance that hints at puddled streets and glistening sidewalks come daylight.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the sky may grant glimpses of sunlight peeking through the clouds, though the remnants of fog may linger, softening the edges of the world. The forecast today allows for a few moments of sun between the rain, with temperatures reaching a mild 58 degrees, creating a mosaic of warmth and chill. Given the dampness, dressing in layers might be the wise choice\u2014think cozy scarves and waterproof jackets\u2014to navigate the brisk wind and occasional sprinkles. A brisk stroll through the historic streets, perhaps with a warm drink in hand, could unfold delightfully, each sip warming the spirit as the city awakens around you. Alternatively, indulging in those small, comforting indoor moments\u2014like browsing a favorite bookstore or sipping coffee at a corner caf\u00e9\u2014might be the perfect way to spend this tranquil day.",
