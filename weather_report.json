    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the summer sun spills its warmth across the city, offering a mostly sunny expanse that beckons residents outdoors. The high heat lingers around a sultry 93 degrees, with the heat index nudging towards 96, hinting at the day's potential to feel even more enveloping. As a gentle southwest breeze dances through the streets, the air remains inviting yet heavy, encouraging those who venture out to remain hydrated and seek shelter from the unrelenting sun when possible. \n\nTonight, the skies will shift to a calm and mostly clear feature, soothing the day's intensity and welcoming a cozy low of around 71 degrees. Evening plans could benefit from the lingering warmth; a casual stroll near the waterfront could be a soothing endeavor, or perhaps an outdoor caf\u00e9 visit to relish the fading daylight. In these conditions, comfort is key. Lightweight clothing paired with a light wrap for the evening would be wise, allowing for ease during the day and warmth as dusk settles in. As the sun embarks on its journey down, remember to cherish both the lingering sunlight and the promise of a serene night ahead.",
