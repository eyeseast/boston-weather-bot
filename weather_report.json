    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Boston, the sky unfolds in a canvas of blue, sprinkled with wisps of clouds that barely dare to disturb the serenity of the day. Today is destined to be warm, with temperatures embracing the mid-80s, while the gentle southwest winds usher in whispers of summer. There\u2019s no hint of fog to obscure the view; instead, the clarity invites one to savor the vibrant scenes of city life poised just below.\n\nAs the sun rises, bringing warmth and brightness, it beckons urban wanderers to step out. Perhaps a leisurely stroll along the Charles River will lead to moments of reflection, or a visit to one of the local cafes can yield a simple pleasure found in coffee and conversation. Layering light fabrics will suffice for attire, allowing for comfort as the temperature gradually ascends, while a light jacket may be welcome as evening settles in, wrapping the city in a soft embrace. The promise of a mostly clear night will inspire outdoor gatherings, making it an ideal time for families and friends to connect under the stars, placing this splendid day into the gentle context of a calm and inviting evening.",
