    "weather_report": "As twilight settles softly over Boston, the city\u2019s pulse lingers in the cool air, the clouds above whispering secrets of a wintry night. The temperature dipping around 25 degrees provides a chill that beckons you to bundle up\u2014think layers, perhaps a snug scarf wrapped against the brisk winds that dance through the streets. The faint gusts in the air promise a blend of quiet anticipation as the night deepens, the illumination from city lights casting a warm glow against the dark.\n\nThe morrow, however, carries the hint of change. A slight chance of snow in the early hours suggests a delicate flurry might grace the morning, only to transition into the hustle of rain as the day unfurls. With a high nearing 44, the atmosphere morphs from the icy grasp of night to a chill more manageable, albeit dampened by the possibility of precipitation that clings to the air. For those seeking solace outside, consider an early visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where rich aromas and gentle conversation might distract from the murky skies. As the clouds roll in, take heed; while the weather may appear dreary, it also embraces the allure of the quiet, unhurried moments that winter gifts us.",
