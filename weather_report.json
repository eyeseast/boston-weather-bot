The evening sky, mostly clear, serves as a fleeting canvas, briefly reflecting the soft glow emanating from the city\u2019s heart\u2014a quiet foresight of what Monday will unveil.\n\nWith the sun's ascent, expect a tapestry of partly sunny skies painting the backdrop for a day dressed in heat. Anticipating highs nearing 91, the atmosphere will hum with warmth, beckoning residents to adapt to the rising heat index, which could flirt with discomfort. One might consider lightweight fabrics\u2014perhaps breezy cottons or linens\u2014and ensure ample hydration for their adventures. As the day unfolds, it invites walks through shaded parks, visits to favorite caf\u00e9s offering cool refreshments, or simply enjoying the lilt of conversation with friends under the calming shadows of trees. With a hint of humidity lingering in the air, it would be wise to seek out moments of respite, perhaps finding a cozy nook in a local bookshop or an airy terrace, thus harmonizing with the rhythms of a Boston summer day.",
