    "weather_report": "In the early hours, Boston is cloaked in a gentle shroud of fog, capturing the serene whisper of the night. As the skies begin to stir awake, the cloud cover hangs low, lending an air of mystery to the city, with temperatures resting comfortably at around fifty-seven degrees. The soft south wind meanders through the streets, inviting early risers to take a moment and breathe in the cool, moist air that fills the dawn. \n\nAs day breaks, the fog may linger until mid-morning, making way for a hint of sunlight that promises a slight clearing, revealing a canvas of partly sunny skies by midday. With a high expected near seventy-three, there will be opportunities to bask in the gentle warmth as the clouds recede. A light southwest breeze will accompany the day, making it quite pleasant despite the earlier scattered showers. Dress in layers to prepare for the changing light\u2014perhaps a light jacket for the morning chill that can easily be shed as day unfolds. \n\nAs the hours pass and the sun timidly displays itself, consider enjoying a leisurely stroll through one of Boston\u2019s thoughtfully tended parks or perhaps a quiet coffee on a patio where the world can be taken in at a relaxed pace. With the chance of rain diminishing, this day feels filled with potential for simple joys, whether it be reading your favorite book or catching up with a friend outdoors, all while being embraced by the welcoming embrace of spring.",
