    "weather_report": "As the city of Boston gently stirs awake, a soft shroud of patchy fog cloaks the landscape, lending an air of mystery to the otherwise familiar streets. The temperature sits comfortably around 64 degrees, a subtle warmth that invites the heart to linger just a moment longer beneath the blankets. A light north breeze whispers through the trees, the kind of breeze that stirs the leaves, encouraging a new day to unfold. As morning progresses, the fog will begin to lift, revealing a canvas painted in strokes of blue and gold\u2014partly sunny skies emerging as the sun stretches lazily over the horizon.\n\nBy midday, Boston will bask in a pleasant warmth, with temperatures climbing close to 83 degrees. It\u2019s the perfect time to don light layers, perhaps a breathable cotton shirt and comfortable shorts, ready to embrace the flickering sunshine. The gentle east wind will keep it from becoming too oppressive, so an airy scarf might offer a touch of elegance while providing some relief from the heat. Ideal activities for such a day include a leisurely stroll along the Esplanade or perhaps a quiet moment in one of the city's verdant parks, where the sweet scent of summer fills the air and invites a gentle sigh of contentment. A perfect day for reflection or a good book beneath the spreading branches, as the world seems to awaken alongside you.",
