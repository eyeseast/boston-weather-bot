    "weather_report": "This morning in Boston, a gentle chill lingers in the air, a reminder that winter holds sway over the city. As the sun rises, it peeks through a veil of clouds, casting a soft light that bathes the skyline in hues of muted pink and blue. With temperatures expected to hover close to that desirable warmth of 31 degrees, the day promises a comfortable outing, though the brisk west wind creates a sharp feel against the skin. \n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds may gather, bringing with them a chance of snow showers. There\u2019s an unmistakable coolness that hints at a winter wonderland, even if just momentarily. Dressing in layers will be wise\u2014a sturdy coat, perhaps a scarf to snugly wrap around the neck, and a good pair of boots will prepare you for any slippery spots as the day transitions to night. With a fleeting glance at the forecast, it might be just the day to enjoy a leisurely stroll along the Charles River or to seek warmth in a tucked-away caf\u00e9, sipping on hot cocoa as the faint possibility of snow adds a touch of magic to the ordinary evening.",
