    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the early morning, Boston rests under a veil of clouds, the air thick with warmth and a hint of moisture, as if the horizon is holding its breath in anticipation. Overnight temperatures settled comfortably around 75 degrees, with a gentle southern breeze stirring softly through the streets. As dawn approaches, a delicate curtain of fog lingers, hinting at a day that promises the embrace of summer, but also the unpredictability of its storms.  \n\nAs the sun climbs higher, expect the clouds to part only slightly, revealing a day that will hover near a sweltering 91 degrees. The heat index may play tricks on our senses, making it feel like 98; this translates to a call for prudent outfits\u2014light, breathable fabrics are essential, with perhaps a splash of color to brighten the muted morning haze. An umbrella might be prudent too, for sporadic showers and thunderstorms may flirt with the afternoon, sticking around long enough to remind us of nature\u2019s caprice. For the adventurous spirit, this is a day to explore hidden nooks, perhaps sip a refreshing iced tea while wandering the quiet paths of Franklin Park or discover the serenity of a local caf\u00e9 as the skies tease with the promise of rain.",
