    "weather_report": "As dawn stretches languidly over Boston, a hushed, blue-grey haze hangs in the air, suggesting that the day ahead is still waking up. The chill permeates the atmosphere, hovering just above freezing, while whispers of sunlight tease the horizon, hinting at brighter moments to come. A gentle southwest wind stirs, a companion that might tug at your coat if you venture outside, subtly encouraging you to dress warmly in layers. A sturdy jacket and perhaps a scarf will serve you well as you navigate this cool morning. \n\nThroughout the day, expect the clouds to begin parting, releasing their hold on the gloomy morning scene. By midday, the sun will bathe the city in a more amiable glow, lifting spirits with its warmth while the chill remains a gentle reminder of the season. In gentle defiance of the cooler temperatures, today invites simple pleasures \u2014 perhaps a stroll along the Charles, where reflections dance upon water, or a quiet moment spent in one of the many cafes tucked within the historic streets, where a warm mug can cradle your hands against the cold. As evening descends, clarity will give way to a cool, clear night, perfect for a moment of quiet observation under a starlit sky. Tonight will be calm, providing a soothing backdrop to end the day, with only a light breeze to keep you company.",
