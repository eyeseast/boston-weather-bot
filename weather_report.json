    "weather_report": "As dawn slowly breaks over Boston, a veil of rain-soaked air lingers, bringing with it a mild chill and hints of fog that snuggle into the corners of the city. The gentle tapping of raindrops against rooftops whispers tales of an overnight shower, while the soft embrace of humidity clutches lightly around shoulders. As the clock ticks toward morning, the remnants of rain will gradually yield to glimpses of sun, though not without a lingering patch of fog that may dance briefly in the early hours, hinting at a morning shrouded in soft hues and muted sounds.\n\nAs midday approaches, the city will shake off its sleepy start, revealing a warmer embrace as temperatures climb toward 77, the daylight promising to be a mix of clearing skies and scattered sunbeams. With a southwesterly breeze tousling hair and lifting spirits, the day holds a gentle invitation for outings. A light jacket may serve well against the remnants of morning coolness, while comfortable layers will provide ease as the sun shines its warmth upon you. Seek out a cozy caf\u00e9 for quiet reflection, or perhaps take a stroll along the Charles to savor the combination of fresh air and a burgeoning springtime palette. Let the day unfold with leisure, embracing both the lingering moisture and the promise of a sunlit afternoon.",
