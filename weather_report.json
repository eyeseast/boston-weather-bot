    "weather_report": "As dawn gently approaches, Boston rests beneath a blanket of quiet tranquility, the air cool and crisp against the skin. The night will bid farewell with only hints of cloud scattered across the sky, promising a low temperature around 59 degrees. A gentle northwesterly breeze lightly stirs, adding a refreshing touch to the calm. \n\nAs the sun climbs higher, Friday will unfold gracefully, presenting mostly sunny skies and beckoning us to embrace the day at a comfortable 77 degrees. It\u2019s an ideal moment to don light layers: perhaps a soft cotton shirt and lightweight trousers, perfect for those occasional wisps of wind that encourage a spring in your step. With the pleasant ambiance, a stroll along the Charles River or a visit to one of Boston's many parks seems most fitting, allowing one to revel in the beauty of the day, perhaps with a good book nestled under one arm. The inviting weather also hints at outdoor caf\u00e9s waiting for patrons, perfect for sipping coffee while savoring the warmth of the sun. As the day unfurls its opportunities, take a moment to appreciate the quiet brightness that comes but once in a while to our bustling city.",
