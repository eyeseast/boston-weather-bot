The warmth of the evening settles around you, with temperatures lingering delightfully near 65. With a slight whisper of wind, tranquility reigns, paving the way for a restful night's sleep before the sun rises to usher in a rejuvenating day.\n\nWhen morning arrives, it breathes life into the city with promises of mostly sunny skies and a tantalizing high nearing 89. The fog will retreat by mid-morning, leaving behind radiant sunlight that dances over the cobblestone streets and historic architecture. A light southeast breeze will accompany the warmth, creating an ambiance perfectly suited for leisurely strolls or perhaps a casual coffee at a local caf\u00e9. Dress in light, breathable fabrics to embrace the warmth, and perhaps carry a light layer for the early hours' cool touch. This is a day best suited for gentle explorations\u2014a visit to a waterfront park, where a good book and the sound of distant laughter can be your steadfast companions as the world awakens around you.",
