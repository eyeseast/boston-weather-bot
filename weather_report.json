    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Boston unfolds under a veil of cloudiness, casting a muted light over the city. Although the air feels heavy with the anticipation of rain, the high reaches a modest 44 degrees, accompanied by a gentle easterly breeze. As the clock nudges toward five, wisps of moisture begin to stir, hinting at a 30% chance of rain\u2014though one might see it more as an invitation to slow down and enjoy the stillness that precedes a storm. By evening, however, the sky will fully embrace its somber tone, as rain descends with a certainty of 100%, bringing the temperature down to about 37 degrees. With new rainfall expected, one could easily find themselves in a scene painted with glistening drops cascading down window panes.\n\nFor those stepping out, layers might be key\u2014perhaps a warm knit scarf paired with a sturdy windbreaker to keep the moisture at bay. The cityscape invites a leisurely stroll through the quieter side streets. Instead of a bustling caf\u00e9, envision a peaceful moment tucked away inside one of the quieter bookstores, where the scent of old pages intermingles with the comforting crunch of leaves underfoot. Alternatively, cozying up at home with a good book while the rain taps a rhythmic lullaby might be the perfect way to embrace this dynamic weather, offering a chance to reflect and recoup amidst the changing season.",
