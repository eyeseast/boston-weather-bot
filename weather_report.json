    "weather_report": "As afternoon unfolds in Boston, the sky is adorned with a delightful tapestry of sun and clouds, creating a backdrop that invites exploration. The high temperature hovers in the comfortable mid-seventies, while a gentle eastward breeze carries the promise of warmth without overwhelming humidity. As the day transitions toward evening, the air will cool gracefully, settling into a pleasant, mild night around 58 degrees, making for a perfect backdrop for leisurely strolls or relaxed gatherings under the stars.\n\nIn such inviting conditions, consider donning lightweight layers that can adapt to the shifting temperatures\u2014a breathable shirt paired with a light jacket or cardigan will be ideal. With the enticing sun overhead, this is a splendid opportunity to visit a cozy caf\u00e9 for an afternoon tea or coffee, perhaps taking a quiet moment to reflect on the week. Alternatively, the charm of an evening walk along the Charles River, where the reflection of city lights dances upon the water, can offer a serene escape from the day's busyness. In short, this is a day beautifully suited for connecting with the outdoors, savoring the simple pleasures that summer has to offer.",
