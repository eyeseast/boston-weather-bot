    "weather_report": "As twilight drapes its soft cloak over Boston, the city's lights begin to glimmer like distant stars, each one a humble reminder of the life that ebbs and flows within its borders. Tonight promises a whisper of fog, creeping in softly between the hours of two and five, casting an ethereal spell over everything it touches. The air carries a slight chill, wrapping around you like a gentle shroud, with temperatures dipping to a low that flirts with the 30s. A light breeze from the southeast meanders lazily, barely rustling the leaves, inviting you to embrace the evening with a cozy sweater or perhaps a light jacket.\n\nLooking toward tomorrow, the dawn will unveil a panorama of patchy fog before the sun rises to greet the day, sending streaks of warmth across the horizon. Expect a serene embrace from warm afternoons, as temperatures reach toward the inviting 60s. As the sun climbs higher, the clouds will part, giving way to a partly sunny disposition, inviting Boston\u2019s denizens to venture outdoors. With the air feeling crisp yet inviting, it's the perfect occasion for a leisurely stroll along one of the city\u2019s scenic parks or a quiet moment at a local caf\u00e9, sipping something warm while watching the world unravel around you. A day like this calls for comfortable attire\u2014a light sweater, perhaps layered with a coat for the morning\u2019s coolness, and sturdy shoes for those impromptu adventures across the inviting streets.",
