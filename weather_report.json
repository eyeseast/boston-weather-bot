With temperatures nudging toward the high 80s, the warmth envelops the city in an inviting embrace, perfect for leisurely strolls along the Charles River or perhaps indulging in a quiet moment in one of the city\u2019s lush parks. As the day moves toward evening, the skies will shift to a gentle repose, layering themselves in clouds that hint at the cool balm of night, signaling a comfortable low around 60 degrees.\n\nThe clarity of the day, though softened with a subtle haze, radiates a sense of calm that invites activity. Light, breathable clothing will ensure comfort while roaming the city\u2019s vibrant streets or enjoying a late afternoon coffee outside. The wind offers a refreshing edge, making it an excellent opportunity for those who find solace in cycling or an invigorating run along the esplanade. As the sun begins its descent, consider a visit to a local spot where the ambience is as warm as the fading light, perhaps a cozy restaurant or a charming outdoor space, allowing you to savor the evening\u2019s tranquility.",
