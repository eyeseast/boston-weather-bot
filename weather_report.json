    "weather_report": "The air hangs still in the early morning hours over Boston, as the city drapes itself in a serene clarity, absent of fog and softened by only the gentle glow of distant lights. With the overnight coolness settling around a comfortable 63 degrees, the day beckons a gradual rise towards warmth, promising a sun-soaked afternoon as the temperature climbs near 93 degrees. Anticipate a few whispers of thunderstorms later, making their approach post-lunchtime, a reminder of nature's unpredictability amid the otherwise inviting sunshine.\n\nAs day breaks, one might consider light and breathable attire to navigate the warmth, perhaps opting for a soft linen shirt and comfortable jeans, perfect for promenade strolls or a leisurely bike ride along the winding Charles River. Venture to a local caf\u00e9 and savor a morning brew while soaking in the burgeoning bustle of the city. Despite the afternoon\u2019s potential for scattered showers and thunderstorms, embracing the day with openness feels right; perhaps a good book or a journal will accompany you, offering enjoyment should the clouds choose to drift ominously overhead in the later hours.",
