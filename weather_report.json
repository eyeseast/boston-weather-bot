    "weather_report": "As the afternoon drifts into the embrace of summer, Boston finds itself caught in a gentle tug-of-war between sun and cloud. The air is laden with the promise of warmth, flirtatiously whispering of a high that flirts near ninety-two. Though the sun peeks from behind cottony clouds, there's a slight chance of rain showers teasing the edges of this idyllic day. As the heat wraps itself around you, creating a sensation akin to a warm embrace, the heat index insists on climbing, making it feel a touch more oppressive than the mercury alone would suggest. \n\nAs twilight approaches, the bustling city may find itself shrouded in patchy fog, a gentle reminder of nature\u2019s hand. The luminous hues of an approaching evening beckon you to savor the outdoor pockets of warmth before retreating indoors. For those strolling through the parks or indulging in an al fresco meal, light, breathable fabrics will serve you well, perhaps a loose cotton shirt paired with shorts, fitting for this sultry summer day. As the sun dips lower, consider unwinding with a leisurely walk along the Charles River, where the fading light dances on the water\u2019s surface, or perhaps indulge in the comfort of a quaint caf\u00e9, enjoying the sounds of laughter alongside your chosen beverage.",
