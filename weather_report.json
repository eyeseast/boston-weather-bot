    "weather_report": "As night settles over Boston, a chill, sharp and penetrating, envelops the city. The sky, cloaked in a thick mantle of clouds, hints at the briskness that has descended. A faint whisper of snow flurries teeters at the edges of historic streets, perhaps a fleeting reminder of winter\u2019s grasp before morning light reveals a landscape smoothed by frost. With temperatures hovering precariously around a brisk low, wind chill steals warmth, urging the city\u2019s dwellers to bundle up in layers of wool and down. A northwest breeze, brisk and determined, wreaks havoc on exposed skin, making even a brief stroll feel like a trek in the arctic.\n\nCome Sunday, the sun promises to ascend, casting a feeble warmth upon a still-cold scene. While the high diurnally climbs, it does so with an air of reticence, as wind chill will linger, sharpening the day. Expect the early hours to dawn bright and merry, ripe for the solace of a quiet walk through frosty parks or a leisurely visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where steam rises from mugs like aspirations in the morning air. For the prepared, an excursion through the icy remnants of snow-dusted landscapes awaits, while one eye remains cast toasty indoors, into the embrace of familiar comforts. \n\nDress warmly, yet perhaps consider a hint of spring\u2019s color to play against the gray tableau. With the bracing air urging all to remain wise, curated engaging plans, devoid of the clich\u00e9 of grand adventures, suit this wintry evening best. An intimate gathering with old friends or a comforting evening with a good book captures the essence of a beautifully cool Boston night.",
