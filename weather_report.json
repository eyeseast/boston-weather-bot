    "weather_report": "As night descends over Boston, a gentle veil of fog begins to weave through the city, casting an ethereal ambiance that softens the chill in the air. This evening, the temperature is quietly settling around 26 degrees, and the stillness is occasionally interrupted by the lightest breath of wind. The patchy fog, enveloping the skyline, creates a scene where the familiar becomes elusive, promising a certain quiet charm for those who venture outside. Clarity is traded for mystery, perfect for contemplative walks or unwinding moments spent at a cozy caf\u00e9, where the warmth draws you in like a comforting embrace.\n\nTomorrow beckons with the potential for more fog interlaced with a hint of rain, particularly in the late afternoon hours. The day promises a gentle rise in temperature, inviting you to dress warmly but not heavily; layers will serve you well. A light jacket paired with a scarf will keep you snug as you navigate the urban landscape, perhaps indulging in a stroll along the waterfront or a leisurely visit to the Boston Public Market\u2014where vibrant offerings from local vendors create a delightful tapestry of community life. In a city that pulsates with energy, even on overcast days like this, there lies the opportunity to find joy in the small moments, where the fog brings a soft focus to the hustle and bustle of everyday life.",
