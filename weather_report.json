    "weather_report": "The night over Boston embraces a cool calmness, with the sky gently fading into the backdrop of a day yet to awaken. Currently, the temperature hovers around the fresh low of 37 degrees, and a gentle west wind whispers at approximately eight miles per hour, promising a crisp start to the morning. As dawn draws closer, the promise of a sunny day emerges, with a high near 58 illuminating the landscape. \n\nToday\u2019s weather invites you to revel in the outdoors. The clarity of the sky ahead portends a pleasantry rarely found in the haze of spring, making it much too inviting to stay indoors. A light jacket will serve you well in the coolness of the morning, while layers become your ally as the sun ascends, warmly greeting the city. A walk through the Common or a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9 could provide a delightful reprieve, a chance to embrace the day as it unfolds. Feel free to explore the charming streets, but be prepared for a gentle breeze as the sun fully graces the horizon.",
