    "weather_report": "As the morning sun pours its gentle light over Boston, it casts a warm glow that belies the chill lingering in the air. Today greets us with a partly sunny visage, the sky a canvas of pale blues, providing a pleasing backdrop against which the city moves about its daily rhythm. Expect a high of 27 degrees, a fickle warmth instilled by a subtle southwest breeze. While the sunshine tempts those craving outdoor respite, the true scent of winter whispers reminders of woolen layers and hearty scarves, essentials for navigating the cooler edges of the day. \n\nHowever, as night draws near, the atmosphere will shift, bringing with it the likelihood of snow between 7 PM and 4 AM, a soft carpet stitched from the heavens set to adorn the city. Before this wintry curtain falls, this afternoon might find you craving a leisurely walk or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of brewing coffee mingles with the chatter of those tucked away from the cold. As cool temperatures rise slightly overnight, an enchanting quietude will blanket the streets, inviting early glimpses of a snow-laden landscape reflecting the soft glow of streetlights. For now, stretch your time beneath the sun, but prepare for the magic of fresh snowfall that awaits as the hours drift by.",
