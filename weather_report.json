    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, a gentle light casts a muted glow on the horizon, signaling a day that promises to unfold under a mostly cloudy sky. The chill of the air clings to the remnants of winter, with temperatures teetering around the low twenties\u2014a reminder that despite the sun\u2019s rising path, spring is still on the distant horizon. While the day may start off brisk, a soft north wind whispers through the streets, a tender invitation to step into the world outside, though a touch of warmth might be required to fend off the lingering coolness.\n\nAs the hours wax on, expect clouds to linger, their gray hues more a veil than a barricade to the sun\u2019s warm embrace. With a slight chance of snow showers creeping in later, there\u2019s an opportunity for whimsical flurries between the hours of darkness, drawing a curtain on the day around midnight. Given the conditions, dressing in layers may be your best defense: a sturdy coat to shield from harsh winds, topped with a cozy scarf and gloves to ward off any unexpected chill. Consider a leisurely stroll through one of Boston's historic streets, or perhaps a quiet afternoon spent at a quaint caf\u00e9, cradling a cup of something warm, as you watch the clouds drift lazily overhead, pondering the stories they might carry.",
