    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the atmosphere hangs heavy with the promise of rain, casting a muted pall over the city. The skies, a quilt of gray, bid farewell to the dawn's fleeting moments of clarity, yielding instead to persistent rain that began its descent before the clock struck one. As the afternoon unfolds, expect not only scattered showers but also the rumble of isolated thunderstorms, all playing out against a backdrop of clouds that seem determined to snuff out any lingering rays of sunlight. A brisk southwest wind rises to meet the gloom, swirling ominously, making it feel even cooler as temperatures dip to a shivery 52 degrees.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the rain may relent slightly, presenting a brief interlude of partly cloudy skies before nightfall. With a low settling down around 27 degrees, a chill will certainly settle in, encouraging anyone venturing outside this evening to bundle up against the bracing air. Opt for layers\u2014perhaps a sturdy jacket to fend off the winds, paired with a cozy sweater and something waterproof on the outside. Given the weather\u2019s temperament, this day lends itself to reflective pursuits: the charm of a local caf\u00e9 beckons, where one might savor a warm drink while watching the world outside soften and blur in the rain. Whether tucked into a book or engaged in conversation, today invites moments of quiet contemplation rather than outdoor revelry.",
