    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Boston, a gentle haze settles over the city, lending a soft mystery to the evening. The patchy fog, a whisper of the night air, gives reassurance on this warm May evening, urging locals to take their time as they wander through the pleasantly humid atmosphere. With temperatures hovering around a balmy 60 degrees, a light layer will suffice, perhaps a sweater or a light jacket to ward off the cool breeze that sometimes flutters in from the south.\n\nTomorrow greets us with more than just the promise of sun peeking through the clouds; it's a chance for Boston to emerge brightly from the morning fog. As the sun climbs higher, expect to see the city bathed in warm golden hues, reaching a comfortable 76 degrees. Perfect for a stroll along the Charles or a leisurely lunch at an outdoor caf\u00e9. A lighthearted exploration of local parks or a simple visit to a bookshop might satisfy your wanderlust, allowing the gentle breeze to invigorate your spirit as you embrace the beauty of spring with minimal fuss.",
