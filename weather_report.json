    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, a light veil of fog continues to cling to the waking city, a gentle reminder of the night just passed. With hints of sunlight starting to emerge, the air is crisp and invigorating, inviting the breath of a new day. As the hours unfold, expect a gradual lifting of the fog, giving way to partly sunny skies. The temperature will dance between the upper fifties and the low fifties as the afternoon progresses, accompanied by a soft southwest wind, adding a touch of warmth while rustling the leaves still clinging to their branches.\n\nAs you step out into this serene morning, consider wearing layers that embrace the transitional weather\u2014a light sweater beneath a jacket may serve you well as the chill will recede by midday. This is a perfect day for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River or perhaps to visit a local caf\u00e9 where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the crisp air. Take in the sights and sounds of the city, perhaps indulging in the simple pleasure of people-watching or reading a book in a park, soaking in the fleeting warmth as the sun continues its journey across the sky.",
