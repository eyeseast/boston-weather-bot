    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds in Boston, a curtain of scattered showers and the rumble of distant thunderstorms set the tone for a rather moody morning. The sky hangs heavy with clouds, casting a muted gray over the cityscape. The temperature is pleasant, hovering near a comfortable 76, inviting those who dare to venture out into the soft embrace of a light south wind. A chance of rain lingers, with only modest expectations of accumulation, evoking a feeling of impermanence as though the day itself might shift with the whims of the weather.\n\nFor those considering a stroll, it may be wise to don a light jacket, perhaps a cardigan that can be artfully wrapped about the shoulders should the temperature dip unexpectedly in the evening. The forecast hints at more rain before the night wraps its arms around the city, and the damp air might hint at some lingering humidity. A bookshop or a cozy caf\u00e9 with the allure of rich coffee and warm pastries could be the perfect refuge to savor the day, allowing a moment of respite while the weather dances outside. As the clock ticks toward evening, a chance remains for more scattered showers, painting the day with the brush of both promise and unpredictability, a London-esque charm flitting sobre the streets of Boston.",
