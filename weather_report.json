    "weather_report": "As the night cloaks Boston in its tranquil embrace, a gentle calm prevails, punctuated only by the soft hum of the city. The air feels cool, carrying the subtle anticipation of the day ahead. Underneath a partly cloudy sky, the temperature rests comfortably near 46 degrees, inviting a light layer to ward off the chill. \n\nAs dawn breaks, the morning promises a playful mix of sun and fleeting clouds, with the mercury creeping to around 61 by afternoon. There\u2019s a possibility of isolated rain showers after 1 PM, brushing the city with a tender mizzle, yet the overall ambiance remains one of mild delight, infused with the breezy caress of a southwest wind that whispers of adventure. In such weather, layers are wise; a cozy sweater paired with a light jacket will allow for the temperature\u2019s dance throughout the day. Amble through the parks, savoring the brisk air and perhaps stopping for a quiet moment with a good book in hand as the clouds play tag with the sun. For those drawn outdoors, this day invites languid strolls along the waterfront or visits to local galleries, where the creativity of Boston shines just as brightly as the sporadic sunbeam cutting through the overcast.",
