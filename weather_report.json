    "weather_report": "In Boston this afternoon, the sun casts a gentle glow across the city, framing a high that nudges close to 77 degrees. The atmosphere is mostly clear, though a gentle curtain of clouds lingers, reminiscent of a soft cotton blanket draped on a warm day. A light breeze carries the hints of summer as the eastern winds whisper through the streets. However, as night draws near, a ripple of uncertainty stirs the air, bringing the possibility of rain after midnight. The temperature will dip comfortably to about 58, inviting a cozy layer for those venturing out as twilight settles.\n\nThe day, while promising a pleasant warmth, also suggests a thoughtful approach to attire\u2014embracing the lightness of summer while readying for evening's cool touch. Perhaps a light jacket or cardigan would be wise as dusk falls. Given the comforting weather and the gentle humidity creeping in, it\u2019s an ideal time for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River, where reflections of the setting sun will dance on the water's surface. Alternatively, a stop at a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh coffee mingles with baked goods, would be a fitting pause as you watch the city prepare for the evening. Amidst all this, a subtle thrill lingers in the air, hinting at the remnants of a lush summer about to unfurl.",
