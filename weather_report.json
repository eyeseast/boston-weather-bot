    "weather_report": "As dawn slowly approaches over Boston, a thick blanket of cloud hangs heavily in the night sky, setting a still, muted scene. The temperature is poised to dip to a chilly 25 degrees overnight, with a whisper of a northwest wind, barely stirring the chill. Come Thursday, the clouds will begin to part, revealing hints of sunlight, allowing the city to breathe a little under a high of 36 degrees. The air will still carry the crispness of winter, approachable yet bracing, making the morning walks feel both invigorating and sharp against the skin.\n\nFor those stepping out into this serene, gray canvas, dressing warmly is essential; layers will serve you well. A thick coat, perhaps complemented by a wool scarf, will provide comfort against the biting breeze that may come and go. With the daylight breaking through later, consider a stroll along the Charles River, where the reflections dance on the water, offering a quiet moment of reflection amidst the bustle of post-holiday life. Alternatively, a visit to one of Boston\u2019s cozy cafes may be fitting, where one can indulge in hot coffee and pastries while watching the city gradually awaken from its slumber. Enjoy these mundane yet precious moments; they embody winter's charm in the city.",
