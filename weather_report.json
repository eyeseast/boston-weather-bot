    "weather_report": "As twilight cloaks Boston in a soft veil, the air hangs with a sense of restless anticipation, tinged with the scent of rain that whispers promises of the night ahead. Tonight, temperatures will descend to a cool embrace, around 43 degrees, while clouds gather like old friends sharing secrets. A faint northeast breeze stirs, bringing with it a gentle chill and a 40% chance of rain after the witching hour. It feels as though nature is holding its breath, waiting for the first drops to fall\u2014a scenario that would cast a romantic shadow over the city\u2019s landmarks.\n\nLooking toward tomorrow, the landscape will shift as morning unfolds. Rain is poised to greet early risers, likely draping the city in a curtain of mist and fog, painting the day in muted shades of gray. The air will chill to around 51 degrees, while the wind picks up, urging residents to seek warmth in cozy layers. Let your style reflect the mood: veils of fabric, perhaps a soft sweater with a water-resistant jacket thrown over, will not only keep you snug but also add a touch of seasonal flair. Amidst the weather's subtle drama, consider casual pursuits\u2014perhaps a meandering stroll through one of Boston\u2019s many museums, where the art can act as a refuge from the brisk air, or a relaxing afternoon in a favorite caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink while raindrops entertain themselves on the windows. The fabric of the day may appear dreary, but there is beauty to be found in each moment of gray.",
