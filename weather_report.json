    "weather_report": "As you step outside into the embrace of a July afternoon in Boston, the air is suffused with warmth, hinting at a high poised near 92. The morning\u2019s drizzle has retreated, leaving behind a veil of humidity that whispers of the sultry hours ahead. A vibrant blue sky stretches overhead, reflecting the cheerful defiance of the clouds that had briefly held court. Amidst a brisk west wind, carrying whispers of comfort, the gentle gusts bring a respite from the heat, though the heat index climbs, potentially reaching 95. \n\nTonight, as the sun dips below the horizon, the promise of a partly cloudy sky will linger, inviting a cozy evening under the stars with temperatures settling around 72. This is a day to embrace the distinctive rhythm of summer in the city. Lightweight fabrics will serve well against the heat, accompanied perhaps by a light jacket for the cooler evening air. You might find yourself meandering through a local park, relishing the gentle sway of nearby trees, or exploring the culinary delights offered by neighborhood eateries, their outdoor seating beckoning amidst the balmy atmosphere.",
