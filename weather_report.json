    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Boston, the sky bears a muted palette that hints at the day's promise of clarity. Today\u2019s weather, though cool, offers a touch of brightness with a gentle sun breaking through the patchy clouds. A brisk breath of northeast wind stirs, reminding us that winter\u2019s chill is still very much around, while a soft fog starts to settle in deeper corners as the night looms near. The temperature will hover around a brisk 44 degrees, inviting residents to wrap themselves snugly in their woolen scarves and mufflers while donning layered clothing to fully embrace the day.\n\nThe evening paints a different picture, cloaked in a light shroud of fog that will sweep in softly after three, casting a serene tranquility over the city. As the sun dips low, a calm southwest breeze whispers through, nudging you to seek warmth indoors or perhaps enjoy a cozy meal at a local caf\u00e9, where conversations and laughter fill the air. It\u2019s the perfect day for a simple stroll through the park, allowing the crisp air to invigorate your spirit, and later, one might settle into a favored armchair for a little reading or to share moments with friends over a warm beverage.",
