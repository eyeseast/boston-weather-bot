    "weather_report": "In the stillness of night, Boston is enveloped in a shroud of snow, the kind that whispers as it falls, coating the streets and rooftops in a delicate layer of white. The air is marked by a raw chill, the kind that seeps into the bones, stirred by easterly winds that carry the promise of more precipitation. As the clock inches towards morning, a sense of anticipation hangs in the air\u2014snow transforming into a slushy mix, and rain sporadically punctuating the blanket of white. Those venturing outside will find themselves knee-deep in slushy streets, wrapped in layers to fend off the biting cold, perhaps donning a sturdy waterproof coat and heavy boots, lest their socks become yet another casualty of the wet conditions.\n\nAs dawn approaches, a gray sky looms overhead, likely to keep the sun at bay. The day will unfold with an uneasy dance between flurries and the inevitable rain, culminating in a moist chill that persists through the afternoon. It may not be the kind of day that invites long walks in the park, but rather one that beckons you to cozy up with a book at a corner caf\u00e9, watching the dance of water droplets against the window, indulging in a warm beverage, and perhaps savoring the quiet moments to yourself. In this weather, the beauty lies in its intimacy\u2014a gentle reminder that sometimes, the coziest places can be found indoors, while the world outside is shrouded in a wintry mist.",
