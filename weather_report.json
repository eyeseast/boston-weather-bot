    "weather_report": "As afternoon settles over Boston, the sky presents a compelling tapestry of mostly sunny intervals interspersed with hints of clouds, casting a warm embrace over the city. While there\u2019s a tantalizing suggestion of rain, the chance remains a thin thread, an alluring whisper rather than a promise as temperatures flirt with the mid-80s. A swift southwest wind carries an anticipatory energy, rustling the leaves with its spirited gusts. \n\nAs dusk approaches, however, a shift is on the horizon. The forecast beckons with the possibility of scattered showers and thunderstorms before nightfall, some of which may even bear a fierce intensity, so an umbrella may serve as a wise companion as the evening unfolds. Temperatures will cool, giving way to a comforting chill that nudges one to reach for a light jacket or sweater as darkness drapes itself over the skyline. \n\nWith the somewhat humid atmosphere and the brewing storms, today\u2019s rhythm invites leisurely strolls through local parks, where the gentle sway of branches accompanies the distant rumble of thunder. Perhaps a quiet caf\u00e9 beckons for reflection with a warm drink, perfect for watching the world outside. Enjoy the rich scent of rain on warm pavement to come, and take in the vibrant energy of a city anticipating change.",
