    "weather_report": "As night hangs over Boston, a gentle cloud cover drapes the city, quietly blurring the sharp edges of the skyline and inviting a brisk chill to settle in. The air, crisp and tranquil, holds around 20 degrees, with whispers of a northwest wind that subtly stirs the branches outside, making the early morning feel both serene and a touch isolated. With the hours creeping toward dawn, the vibrant city lights flicker like distant stars, breaking the darkness with their warm glow to create a tapestry of urban life waiting to awaken.\n\nCome Friday, the clouds will part to reveal a splendid sun that will warm the day, reaching a more mild high near 35. The morning's stillness will give way to clearer skies, urging those who\u2019ve spent the night nestled indoors to emerge and embrace the crispness of the day ahead. The inviting sunshine should coax many out for a leisurely stroll along the Charles, perhaps a quiet moment spent at a cozy caf\u00e9, where the warmth from freshly brewed coffee can mirror the sun's gentle touch upon the skin. For ideal comfort, layering is key\u2014think a soft sweater beneath a sturdy coat, complemented by a warm scarf. In this enchanting blend of light and cool air, the day promises to be not just pleasant but also an exquisite canvas inviting exploration and reflection.",
