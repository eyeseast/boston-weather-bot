    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Boston, a chill lingers in the air, and the sky is cloaked in clouds, reminiscent of a film noir\u2014that touch of mystery wrapping the city in a soft embrace. With temperatures dipping to around 36 degrees, a gentle southwest breeze whispers through the streets, urging you to don layers of warmth before venturing outdoors. The promise of rain looms in the distance, slated to unfurl with the dawn, so tonight's quiet is merely the calm before the storm. \n\nTomorrow, as Thanksgiving approaches, the atmosphere will shift dramatically. Predicted rain washes over the city, drenching the landscape in a symphony of greys. Highs will crest at a modest 47, accompanied by a brisk eastern wind, setting the stage for a day of indoor gatherings, where warmth and company will be prized above all. For those tipped to embrace the elements, a sturdy umbrella and a water-resistant coat will serve you well as you navigate the puddles and reflections on the cobbled streets. While the outdoor adventure may not beckon, the cozy confines of home or a favorite caf\u00e9 await, inviting you to linger over warm drinks and shared stories. It is a time to huddle together, exchanging gratitude not only for abundance but for the simple comforts of togetherness that shine brightly against the backdrop of a grey day.",
