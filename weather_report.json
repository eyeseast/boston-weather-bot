    "weather_report": "Fog blankets Boston this morning, wrapping the city in a gauzy embrace, where visibility wanes into the muted grayness. Rain showers linger, casting a gentle patter upon the pavement, accompanied by a whispering wind that hints of the chill in the air. As the clock ticked towards noon, the promise of a slight respite emerged, but the day remains predominantly under the influence of this cool, damp weather. Those venturing outside will find the temperatures steady yet uninviting, nudging towards the chill of late afternoon.  In this atmospheric embrace, dress warmly \u2014 a cozy sweater paired with a sturdy rain jacket will serve you well against the brisk breeze and the stubborn drizzle.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the clouds may part enough to reveal fleeting patches of sun, hinting at potential moments of clarity. Yet, the call of the cloudy skies may steer you toward indoor pursuits. Perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9 where warmth and gentle conversation can stave off the melancholy of the fog, or an exploration of Boston\u2019s rich tapestry of bookstores and galleries, where the art and literature offer refuge from the dreary conditions outside. Tonight, as the sky clears to reveal a twinkling nocturnal charm, a soft jacket will suffice, and the atmosphere invites quiet contemplation or the kind of leisurely stroll that warms the soul and sharpens the senses.",
