    "weather_report": "In Boston, the afternoon unfolds beneath a veil of clouds, their gray tones casting a subdued ambiance over the city. The air is cool yet moderately inviting at around sixty-two degrees, accompanied by a gentle south wind that whispers through the streets, hinting at the rain that will weave its way into the night. As the sun makes its way toward the horizon, a curtain of stillness settles over the landscape, punctuated only by the occasional flutter of leaves stirred by the breeze. This evening, expect rain showers to sweep in shortly after midnight, as the temperatures dip to a brisk forty-nine. A promise of eighty percent precipitation looms over the city, with whispers of a fine mist falling gently, making the air even cooler and crisper.\n\nAs clouds blanket the sky, envision dressing in layers\u2014a light sweater adorned with a scarf, perhaps, complemented by a waterproof jacket ready to shield against the impending showers. Today invites simple pleasures: perhaps a leisurely stroll through the cobbled streets, savoring a warm cup of coffee or a visit to one of Boston\u2019s many intimate bookshops, where the scent of old volumes mingles with the aroma of freshly brewed pastries. The gray sky can inspire reflection and quiet moments, perfect for seeking out a cozy corner to read or to muse quietly by the window, watching droplets play their dance against the glass.",
