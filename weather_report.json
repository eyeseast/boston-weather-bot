    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun gently casts its light over Boston, the city is embraced by a tapestry of partly sunny skies, with wisps of cloud drifting lazily above. The air carries a mild warmth, with a hint of briskness courtesy of a southwest wind that dances through the streets, stirring the vibrant energy of a late spring day. Areas of the city glimmer beneath the soft sunlight as trees sway lightly, creating a peaceful backdrop that invites a leisurely exploration or perhaps a stroll through one of Boston's myriad parks. As the day rolls on toward evening, the clouds will gather; however, they will not fully obscure the charms of the city. \n\nAs the twilight hours approach, temperatures will taper off, settling into an inviting coolness down to the mid-fifties. A light jacket or a cozy sweater will be the perfect companion for those who venture out to experience the soft murmur of the city at dusk. The blend of warmth and cool air, along with the gentle stir of evening breezes, sets the stage for a delightful dinner al fresco or an easygoing gathering among friends. Whether it\u2019s sipping a craft beer at a rooftop venue or relishing a good book in the comfort of home, the delicate balance of today\u2019s weather promises a pleasant closing chapter to the day.",
