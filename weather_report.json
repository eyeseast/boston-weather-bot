    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens in Boston, a soft shroud of fog envelopes the city, mingling with the gentle patter of impending rain. The air feels charged, hinting at the storms that are likely to dance across the skyline. With temperatures languishing around sixty-one degrees, a cool breeze stirs, barely rustling the leaves, whispering sweetly to those who venture outdoors. Tonight\u2019s forecast promises scattered thunderstorms, a rendezvous of clouds delighting in their dark brooding against the night. With a 70% chance of rain, it's a time to prepare an umbrella rather than to expect the stars to peek through.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the fog will linger into the morning, perhaps as a test for those who venture out early. The atmosphere will remain heavy with moisture, promising further showers and thunderstorms. With a high of sixty-seven degrees, the temperature will invite a light jacket paired with hearty footwear\u2014maybe even worn under the flicker of streetlights as you navigate familiar pathways adorned with puddles. In such weather, one might find solace in a local caf\u00e9, sipping a warm beverage while the rhythm of rain plays a soft symphony against the windows. Or perhaps, a leisurely stroll through the dim streets of the city, listening to the echoes of life in motion, is a fitting embrace of the damp evening.",
