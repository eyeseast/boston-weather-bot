    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the sun casts a gentle light over the city, offering a crispness that beckons for a stroll. The temperature, while peaking near a brisk 46 degrees, will yield to a coolness as the afternoon unfolds. The west wind, nimble and playful, dances through the streets with gusts that remind us of winter\u2019s lingering presence. As dusk approaches, the skies will clot with clouds, hinting at a whisper of snowflakes that may flirt with the city between late night and midnight, before the cold gives way to a gentle warmth overnight.\n\nFor those emerging into this winter's day, a layered outfit would serve you well; a light jacket accompanied by a sturdy scarf will keep both warmth and style intact against the playful winds. As the sun dips closer to the horizon, perhaps indulge in a quiet walk along the Charles River, where the clear skies provide a canvas for the day\u2019s gradual transformation. Whether it\u2019s the briskness of fresh air or the soft chill as night draws closer, today offers a chance to revel in simple pleasures\u2014perhaps a cozy corner of your favorite caf\u00e9 where you can watch the world drift by.",
