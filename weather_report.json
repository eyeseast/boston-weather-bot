    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the night, Boston is embraced by the rhythmic patter of rain, a soothing backdrop for those tucked away in warmth, anticipating the storms yet to arrive. The scent of damp earth mingles with a hint of ozone, a reminder of the promise that thunderstorms will surge forth. As the night deepens, temperatures hover subtly around 61 degrees, with a gentle northeast breeze wrapping around the city, creating a cozy yet dynamic atmosphere. Should you find yourself venturing outdoors, dress in layers; a light rain jacket might be your best companion, ready to shield against the drizzles and gusts as the evening unfolds.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the day promises to be one of muted tones and cloud-draped skies, a harbinger of further rain showers. With the mercury nudging close to 69 degrees, the air will hold a sense of anticipation, and the sounds of storm clouds will linger, offering a melancholic beauty to the urban landscape. Consider embracing the indoor comforts: perhaps a leisurely perusal at a local coffee shop, where the smell of freshly brewed drinks creates a sanctuary from the dampness outside. Alternatively, a quiet stroll under umbrellas could unveil the oft-overlooked charm of Boston\u2019s streets, where the reflections from puddles reveal a soft, poetic side to the bustling city. On a day like this, pause to savor the small things, finding joy in simplicity as rain dances against your surroundings.",
