    "weather_report": "As the evening settles in over Boston, the air carries a gentle coolness, a hint of the chill that marks the transition into winter. With clouds cloaking the night sky, temperatures hover around a brisk 38 degrees. The faint rustle of wind from the north whispers through the streets, creating an almost ethereal backdrop for the flickering city lights below. It\u2019s a time to embrace layers\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater beneath a light jacket, accompanied by a warm scarf to ward off the night\u2019s embrace.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the atmosphere will shift as the day brings the promise of rain, anticipated to begin after lunch. While the morning may still retain its cloud-clad demeanor, the afternoon threatens to drench the city with a likely downpour, painting the landscape in shades of grey and silver. With a high near 56, the wet air could feel a bit more brisk, nudging passersby to seek the comfort of indoor pursuits as raindrops rhythmically dance on sidewalks. A lazy afternoon reading in a caf\u00e9, or perhaps a casual stroll by the Charles, would match the mood perfectly\u2014just remember that waterproof footwear and an umbrella will be your best companions. Embrace this chapter of the season\u2019s slow turn, as nature draws the curtain with moments rich in resilience and reflection.",
