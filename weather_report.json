    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun bathes Boston in a warm embrace, a slight breeze stirs the air, whispering promises of summer and the day's transient nature. The atmosphere hums with the anticipation of pop-up thunderstorms, flickering like the brief brush of a moth against the window at twilight. Highs will hover around a sultry 93 degrees, but don\u2019t be surprised if cooler remnants sweep in as the day unfurls. Those scattered showers and the playful thunderheads flirt with the horizon, reminding us that while the heat wraps around us, a touch of relief is always just one downpour away. \n\nAs twilight descends, the clouds will morph, weaving a tapestry of gray and gold, eventually scattering light rain before 8 PM. With the temperature settling down to a more refreshing 65, the evening beckons for a light jacket\u2014perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River or perhaps a spontaneous coffee run to savor the city's vibrant, bustling energy. Layer up lightly; a comfortable cotton or a breezy linen will suit the shifting temperatures nicely. It\u2019s a day that invites quiet contemplation, the hum of life intertwining with the rhythm of nature, suggesting that while the storms may gather, moments of stillness are always within reach.",
