    "weather_report": "As twilight drapes itself over Boston, the air carries a certain chill, hinting at the night ahead. Fresh snowflakes are poised to embrace the ground, a delicate curtain descending before dawn, promising a transformation of the city into a serene winter tableau. The forecast whispers of a cozy low, and though the winds are soft, their presence offers a gentle reminder that winter's embrace is still upon us. A dance between snow and rain awaits in the early hours, each drop contributing to a symphony of sounds in the silent streets.\n\nTomorrow dawns with hopeful clarity, a sunlit canvas that beckons the clouds to retreat. The day is set to unfold under a sky brushed with shades of blue, a welcome respite from this evening's damp gloom. As you contemplate your wardrobe, consider layering against the cold\u2014perhaps a woolen scarf to drape around your neck, accompanied by a sturdy jacket to shield against the lingering chill. With winter's grip loosening, a stroll through the park or a quiet afternoon at a nearby caf\u00e9 comes to mind, inviting you to savor the lingering warmth of a cup in hand as you watch the world brighten with the day.",
