    "weather_report": "As night drapes its soft cloak over Boston, the atmosphere is heavy with anticipation, a promise of rain lurking just beyond the horizon. The temperature sits low, brushing the chill of the early morning air, lending itself to a sense of solemn stillness. The clouds roll in, thick and gray, veiling the city in a muted shroud, while the whispered winds gently tease through the streets. Those who venture out will find a morning best suited to layers; perhaps a warm sweater under a durable coat, shielding against the dampness while keeping the chill at bay.\n\nAs the day unfolds, rain is likely to establish its presence, inviting residents to trade their morning coffee for a comforting cup of tea. The high will rise, yet the skies will remain stubbornly overcast, casting a cool palette over the city. The occasional gust of wind may rattle the branches and rustle the leaves, but the urban landscape, under a blanket of clouds, will reveal its own beauty. Enjoy a quiet stroll through the nearby parks, where the sounds of falling droplets create a gentle symphony, or lose yourself in a cozy nook of your favorite caf\u00e9, watching the world drift by through misty windows. With every raindrop, Boston reminds us of the quiet joys found in the comforting embrace of an indoor refuge, reveling in the small moments that bring us together, even on a day that feels marked by the weight of a gray sky.",
