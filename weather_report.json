    "weather_report": "As the clock glides toward midnight, Boston finds itself enveloped in the kind of quiet that comes with patchy fog, cloaking the streets with a shrouded mystery. Tonight's atmosphere is thick with an unhurried haze, punctuated only by the muted glow of city lights that twinkle faintly in the distance. A gentle, warm wind whispers through, hinting at the rain that will likely join this evening\u2019s veil. The air feels cool and damp, an invitation to bundle up against the chill, perhaps donning a cozy sweater or light jacket for the journey ahead.\n\nAs Monday dawns\u2014albeit reluctantly under a veil of clouds\u2014the promise of rain showers heightens, with a sense of urgency in the air. The day is poised for a slow dance between fog and moisture, leading to a high of 57, only to tumble into the cooling embrace of late afternoon. The evening's walk should likely include a sturdy umbrella and waterproof shoes, preparing for what might be a rather drizzly adventure. With such atmospheric conditions, the best course of action may involve indoor endeavors. Perhaps a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of espresso mingles with the whisper of conversation, or a stroll through a museum, where creativity flourishes amidst the soft patter of rain against the windows. Today, the city invites explorers to seek warmth and comfort while the sky plays out its own moody symphony.",
