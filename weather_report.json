    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Boston greets you with a muted palette of grays and blues, as rain showers linger like shy guests at a gathering, wrapping the city in a cloak of fog until the mid-afternoon hours. The temperature is softening, ushering in a gentle descent from the earlier warmth, dropping as the clouds gather and drift, driven by a cool northwest wind. If you venture outdoors, it would be prudent to wear a light waterproof jacket, perhaps paired with comfortable layers beneath, as the chill begins to weave its way into the air, whispering promises of the approaching night.\n\nAs twilight descends, the sky will gradually unveil itself, shifting from the grayness into clearer realms, offering relief from the dampness. With a low settling in around 42 degrees, it would be wise to add a cozy scarf or perhaps a knit beanie for warmth against the brisk evening. Given the weather\u2019s shifting nature, a stroll through the quieter streets of your neighborhood could offer a refreshing sense of peace, as the rain subsides and the city\u2019s subtle charm starts to unfurl amid the fading light. A comforting cup of coffee or tea could perfectly accompany the day\u2019s conclusion, inviting reflection and relaxation as the world outside turns distinctly cooler and serene.",
