    "weather_report": "Evening descends upon Boston, blanketing the city in a veil of soft snow. The air is crisp, with a bite that lingers at around 16 degrees, compounded by a breezy northwest wind that whispers through the streets. Under the heavy clouds, snowflakes drift silently, creating a serene hush that envelops the neighborhoods, promising an accumulation that might transform the urban landscape into a winter wonderland by morning. Tonight invites a certain stillness, a perfect opportunity to nestle indoors with a warm drink, perhaps indulging in a good book or the polished tones of your favorite music. \n\nAs dawn breaks on M.L. King Jr. Day, a shift is promised: the sun will emerge, casting a brighter hue across the remaining snow, filling the city with a robust cheer. Highs near 25 will beckon residents outdoors for a brisk stroll, ideal for enjoying the crisp air and gleaming parks adorned with glistening snow. For this outing, layering should be the key\u2014perhaps a thick wool sweater under a well-fitted coat, coupled with a warm scarf, would keep you snug against the chill. It\u2019s a day ripe for simple pleasures: walking along the Charles, sharing pathways with fellow Bostonian wanderers, or indulging in a cozy caf\u00e9 alive with the scent of freshly ground coffee, perfect for rounding out this winter\u2019s day.",
