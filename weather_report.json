    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Boston, the city finds itself cloaked in a shroud of clouds and impending rain. The scent of damp earth hangs gently in the air, promising the embrace of moisture as the evening unfolds. The temperature hovers comfortably around fifty-one degrees, but with gusts reaching nearly thirty-one miles per hour, there is a briskness that hints at the storm ahead. Tonight, the rain will wash over the streets, punctuated by patches of fog that will weave their way through the city's storied alleys, rendering familiar sights into soft, elusive shadows. \n\nTomorrow greets us with a fleeting chance of rain early in the morning, before the clouds may part partially to reveal a shy sun peeking out amid temperatures near fifty-seven. The southwest winds should lend a gentler touch, though one would be wise to wrap oneself in layers\u2014perhaps a light waterproof jacket and a cozy scarf. As you navigate the streets, embrace the simple pleasures of an evening indoors, perhaps curled up with a good book or enjoying a warm cup at your favorite local caf\u00e9, letting the rhythmic patter of rain provide a soothing backdrop to your evening.",
