    "weather_report": "As dawn edges closer, Boston lies enveloped in a gentle embrace of clouds, the air thick with the scent of impending rain. A sense of moisture lingers, promising the possibility of showers as the night wanes but simultaneously inviting the soft glow of the city\u2019s lights to dance against the encroaching gray. The expected chill in the air suggests that a light jacket or perhaps a cozy sweater would be wise against the cool, southeast breeze that brushes lightly through the streets.\n\nToday, the weather unfolds with rain showers likely before the sun\u2019s ascent, fading into patchy fog as the morning continues, painting a picture of somber tranquility. The high of 62 might urge one to seek comfort in layers, while the softness of the rain invites a slower pace\u2014perhaps a quiet stroll through the Arnold Arboretum, where the fragrance of damp earth and fragrant blossoms can offer a moment of solitude amidst the urban bustle. Today is not about grand adventure; rather, it\u2019s a gentle reminder to appreciate the understated beauty of a city softly veiled in mist and mystery.",
