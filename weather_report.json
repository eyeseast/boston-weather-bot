    "weather_report": "In the cool embrace of a Boston night, the streets lie under a tapestry of silence, save for the gentle hum of distant traffic. With temperatures dipping to a crisp 21 degrees, the air feels fresh, almost fragrant with anticipation as daylight approaches. A slight westerly breeze caresses the landscape, whispering secrets of the day that is to come. As dawn tiptoes onto the scene, a tapestry of sunlight will unfurl, promising a sunlit Sunday where warmth will graciously climb to a comfortable 32 degrees.\n\nThe expected clarity of the day invites warm attire\u2014think snug layers, perhaps a woolen scarf and a sturdy coat to combat that early morning chill. As the sun ascends, its rays will dance upon the cobblestones and shimmer through the trees, creating an inviting atmosphere where exploration beckons. Picture a leisurely walk along the Charles River, where the soothing waters reflect the gradual awakening of the city, or perhaps a visit to one of Boston\u2019s many cozy caf\u00e9s, where the scent of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the tantalizing aroma of baked goods. It is a day painted in the soft hues of a gentle winter, where the allure of the outdoors entwines with the comfort of a warm hearth.",
