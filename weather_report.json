    "weather_report": "Boston slumbers beneath a quiet blanket of darkness tonight, the kind that wraps the city in a tender embrace and allows its myriad lights to flicker like distant stars. With temperatures settling around a brisk 21 degrees, the air is crisp, carrying only whispers of the northwest wind brushing through the skeletal branches of winter trees. As the hours slip by, those who venture out into the night will find the clarity of the air accompanying a certain stillness, a moment suspended just before dawn. \n\nCome Sunday, the sun promises to rise with vigor, casting its golden gaze upon the city and nudging temperatures toward a radiant 34. Bright skies will reign as the day unfolds, inviting Bostonians outdoors, where they can feel the gentle stir of the wind as it shifts from a cool whisper to a more playful breeze. Dressing warmly in layers will be essential, with a sturdy coat to guard against the lingering chill and perhaps a scarf to shield one's throat from the brisk embrace of January. For those looking to seize the day, a stroll along the banks of the Charles or a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9 could be just the remedy for winter\u2019s solemnity, allowing conversations to flow as freely as the coffee.",
