    "weather_report": "As dawn gives way to a quieter morning in Boston, the atmosphere is marked by a gentle mix of clouds against a backdrop of expansive sky. The brisk west wind, whispering through tree branches, carries with it the chill characteristic of spring, nudging the thermometer to a comfortable yet fresh high of 56 degrees. With gusts that dance around 31 mph, one may find a vibrant energy in the air, a readiness that beckons all to step outside. \n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds will part slightly, inviting glimpses of starlight amid a cool embrace that promises a low of 48 degrees tonight. It\u2019s a day when layering becomes essential; a light sweater or jacket paired with a scarf provides warmth against the brisk breeze, while comfortable shoes invite leisurely strolls through the streets or along the Charles. One might find pleasure in a quiet afternoon of visiting local coffee shops, indulging in warm beverages, or perhaps taking a walk through the emerald parks that spring forth with life and color. After all, this beautiful city, with its historic charm and urban rhythm, is best explored at a personal pace, letting the whispers of the evening guide the way.",
