    "weather_report": "As Boston awakens under a brilliant blue sky, the day unfolds with a promising warmth for winter. Sunlight pours over the city, casting long shadows and illuminating the serene landscape. Despite the chill in the air, the high near 22 degrees offers a refreshing reprieve from the frigid bites of recent days. The breeze from the northwest carries a whisper of clarity, inviting a leisurely stroll or perhaps a quiet coffee at a nearby caf\u00e9 with friends. \n\nHowever, as evening approaches, the scene will shift dramatically. The skies will remain mostly clear, but the temperature will plummet, dipping down to a crisp low of around 1 degree. Those venturing outside should prepare well; layers will be essential in this stark contrast, and warmth will be your best companion. A cozy scarf, reliable gloves, and a woolen hat will serve you well as the wind chill could drive the feels-like temperature to a biting -10. It is one of those days where, despite the morning's allure, a snug gathering with a book or the soft glow of streaming lights may be the most rewarding pursuit. As the sun sinks lower in the sky, consider curling up within the comfort of home, savoring a warm drink while watching the world transition into a still winter night, all under the vast expanse of a glittering sky.",
