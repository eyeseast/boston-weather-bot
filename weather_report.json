The air is crisp, hinting at a cool beginning to the day with temperatures expected to dip around 41 degrees. The whisper of a west wind at 8 mph stirs gently, promising a serene transition into morning.\n\nUpon the break of dawn, Boston will greet the sun with open arms. The forecast heralds a sunny day, with generous rays lifting temperatures to the pleasant upper 60s before a gentle slide back into chillier afternoon embrace at around 57. The wind will pick up, offering invigorating gusts that dance through the streets and parks, ideal for a brisk walk or a moment\u2019s pause on a bench to soak in the clear skies and vibrant views of autumn\u2019s fading palette. For those venturing out, a light jacket layered over a comfortable shirt will be just enough to stave off the morning chill while allowing for a relaxed afternoon exploration. As sunset approaches, consider meandering through the cobblestone streets of Beacon Hill, where layers of history meet the pulse of a city awash in the golden glow of twilight.",
