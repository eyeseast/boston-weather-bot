    "weather_report": "As evening cloaks Boston in a gentle embrace, the air feels crisp, carrying with it a sense of quiet anticipation. Tonight, the sky is mostly clouded, a tapestry of gray, though temperatures will rise ever so slightly, teasing a change in the chilled atmosphere. Winds dance in from the southwest, their whispers carrying promise but hinting at a bite to the air. The city, adorned in its night lights, seems to sigh beneath a thin veil of clouds, with gusts that playfully skitter through the darkened streets.\n\nSunday promises a shift, as the sun will break through the clouds, casting a pale, but inviting light over the day. Even as temperatures peak at a modest warmth, they will gently descend, encouraging a cozy layering of attire to keep the chill at bay. Perfect for a day spent wandering the storied streets, perhaps stopping into a local caf\u00e9 for a warm drink or exploring the quiet beauty of one of Boston's many parks. As dusk beckons once more, consider a stroll along the waterfront, where the soft ripples of water share secrets with the glimmering skyline.",
