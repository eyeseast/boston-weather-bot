    "weather_report": "In the soft, muted embrace of night, Boston settles under a mostly cloudy quilt, with a chill that hints at the frost of winter. As the temperature drifts down to around 26 degrees, a gentle southwest breeze whispers through the streets, barely stirring the air. It is a time when the city seems to slow, the lights casting a glimmer upon the crisper edges of reality, while the promise of snow looms on the horizon as dawn approaches.\n\nTomorrow dawns with the expectation of snow accompanied by patchy fog and rain, a mix that can only be described as a painter\u2019s palette spilled in the morning light. As the day unfolds, one can anticipate a cloudy yet cozy atmosphere, with highs reaching into the dull thirties. To step outside is to embrace the essence of winter\u2014wear layers that hug gently against the skin, perhaps a scarf to shield against the biting chill, and sturdy boots that can navigate the slosh of melting snow and rain. Beneath the blanket of gray skies, one might find companionship in quiet indoor pursuits: a visit to a local caf\u00e9, a meandering stroll through museum halls, or simply the pleasure of curling into a warm nook with a favorite book. As the day wears on, the world may feel shrouded in a soft mystery, where every breath of fog invites a moment of reflection amid the bustle of life.",
