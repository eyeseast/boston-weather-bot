    "weather_report": "The evening in Boston unfolds under a veil of patchy fog, gently cloaking the city in a soft, muted ambiance, the clouds whispering hints of moisture that linger in the air. The temperature settles around a balmy 71, tempting a cozy evening stroll down the dimly lit streets or perhaps a quiet gathering on a porch, where the warm breezes breeze lightly tease through. As the night deepens, you may feel the soft caress of a gentle south wind\u2014a reminder of summer's embrace that could lull one into a tranquil state of reflection.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the sun shall rise and sprinkle its light generously across the horizon, promising a day alive with warmth as temperatures climb toward a toasty 89. Before this brilliance unfurls, a morning encore of patchy fog might offer a serene backdrop, soon giving way to a sky that is mostly sunny, inviting exploration and leisure. As you contemplate the day's activities, consider a light outfit to suit the balmy temperatures; breathable fabrics will keep you comfortable as you engage in simple pleasures\u2014like wandering through the city's vibrant markets, sipping coffee in the shade of a tree-lined caf\u00e9, or enjoying a leisurely bike ride along the Charles River, soaking in the gentle hum of a summer day.",
