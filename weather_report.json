The easterly breeze, soft yet persistent at around 10 mph, carries with it whispers of the nearby ocean, blending seamlessly with the laughter of passersby. As clouds drift lazily across the sky, they add just enough character to keep the day from feeling mundane, and any hint of fog is nowhere to be found. The clarity of the skyline offers a picturesque view, where the iconic buildings stand tall against a backdrop of blue.\n\nAs the sun dips lower, the promise of a mostly cloudy evening approaches.
