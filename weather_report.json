    "weather_report": "As the afternoon sun casts its golden glow over Boston, the city finds itself enveloped in warmth, with temperatures nudging near 94 degrees. The air is alive yet bears a heavy embrace, as the heat index climbs closely behind, whispering of humid moments ahead. The sky stretches wide and clear, punctuated by fleeting clouds that drift lazily, hardly daring to obscure the brilliance of the day. This is a time to revel in the clarity of the atmosphere, where the contours of the city stand bold against the horizon, inviting a leisurely exploration.\n\nAs evening draws near, the agreeable warmth promises to linger, settling into a gentler low of around 70. This is a perfect opportunity for a stroll through the vibrant streets, perhaps a quiet meal at an outdoor caf\u00e9 where the evening light dances on the surfaces, creating moments both vivid and serene. In such weather, light and breathable fabrics suit best, perhaps a soft linen shirt paired with comfortable shorts or trousers, providing ease against the enveloping warmth. The afternoon\u2019s golden hours wait to be seized, perhaps with a visit to a local park or a quiet walk by the Charles River, allowing the harmonious buzz of summer to seep into your bones.",
