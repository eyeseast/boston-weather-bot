    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Boston unfolds with a gentle charm, a predominance of blue overhead tempered by wisps of clouds, casting a serene light across the landscape. As the day matures, the temperatures will delicately descend from a warm embrace of 72 down to a comfortable 66, kissed by the cool breath of a northeast wind whispering through the streets. The clarity of the air suggests a crispness, inviting all to step outside and feel the fleeting warmth of the sun upon their skin before it gently yields to twilight.\n\nAs the sun sets, the evening will reveal a mostly clear sky, perfect for quiet wanderings or a contemplative moment on your favorite park bench as the world begins to dim. With a low of 53 hovering on the horizon, a light sweater or a jacket will suffice to ward off the evening chill. Whether lingering at a cozy caf\u00e9 with friends or perusing the bustling streets to catch a glimpse of the life that continues to pulse around you, today offers the perfect backdrop for simple yet enriching pursuits. Engage in leisurely strolls down the riverwalk or explore a nearby bookstore, wrapping yourself in the gentle rhythm of the city as it transitions into night.",
