    "weather_report": "As the night drapes its velvet cloak over Boston, a serene calm envelops the city, pinned under the gentle twinkle of urban lights. With temperatures dipping to a crisp 9 degrees, the air carries a refreshing bite, inviting coats and perhaps a well-worn beanie to keep the chill at bay. The wind whispers softly from the northwest, barely stirring, creating a tranquil backdrop for those who dare to venture out this late. Tonight is marked by a clear sky, unmarred by fog, allowing the stars to strut their brilliance over the rooftops and skyline.\n\nLooking ahead to the morrow, a promising warmth is hinted at\u2014a sunlit embrace with highs near 30 degrees. A gentle southwest breeze will accompany the day, coaxing the last remnants of winter's chill away as the sun dances across the sky. The promise of a mostly sunny day paints the morning with optimism, suggesting a brisk stroll through one of Boston's storied parks or perhaps a leisurely visit to a quiet caf\u00e9 to savor a warm beverage amidst the city's rhythmic pulse. It\u2019s a day for light layers; a warm sweater beneath a light jacket will serve you well, balancing comfort with an easy elegance. Engage with the day as the city stirs to life; watch the world awaken, colors emerge and the everyday bustle fill the streets with energy.",
