    "weather_report": "As night envelops Boston, a serene chill settles over the city, with temperatures dipping to a brisk 24 degrees. The gentle south wind whispers through the streets, bringing with it a hint of anticipation for the coming day. Tomorrow promises a lively shift as rain likely sweeps in, likely falling from the gray skies between the late morning and afternoon hours. The warmth of the day will struggle to break the threshold of 45, while the wind picks up in strength, gusting to 22 mph. Clouds will weave their tapestry overhead, blurring the outlines of the familiar skyline.\n\nFor those venturing outside, layering will be key\u2014a cozy sweater or heavy jacket will add comfort against the dampness that is sure to permeate the air. Perhaps a quiet afternoon is in order, savoring a warm cup of coffee indoors or exploring the hidden gems of the city\u2019s cafes. The charm of the rain can transform an ordinary day into something soothing; it creates the perfect backdrop for reading, reflecting, or simply watching the world pass by through fogged windows. Embrace the calm, whether it\u2019s a stroll under an umbrella or cozying up with a good book as the rain sings its gentle lullaby.",
