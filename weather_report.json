    "weather_report": "As the quiet hours of the early morning envelop the city of Boston, the stars gently fade into the backdrop of a fresh day, offering a promise of clarity and warmth. With a tranquil semi-darkness lingering in the air, the low temperature hovers in a comforting embrace of about fifty-seven degrees, complemented by a soft, southwest breeze that brushes against the skin like a whisper of the day to come. \n\nAs dawn unfolds, anticipate a sun-drenched afternoon where the radiant warmth of eighty-three degrees invites an escape from the confines of indoor life. The gentle southeast winds pave the way for a day filled with brightness and clear skies\u2014perfect for a leisurely stroll through the emerald parks, perhaps a visit to an artisanal caf\u00e9, or a serenely enriching walk along the Charles River. For this embrace of summer, layering your attire is wise; a simple short-sleeved shirt under a light cardigan or shawl can keep one comfortable as the morning's chill dissipates into the heat of midday. So, slip into something that stirs the senses, and allow the day's luminous clarity to cast a spell on your routine.",
