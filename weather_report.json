    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds in Boston, a shroud of clouds drapes the city, the air sharp and bracing, with a chill settling around 24 degrees. The south winds whisper through the night, soft and steady at about 7 to 10 miles per hour, adding an edge to the coolness that permeates the atmosphere. This quiet night lays the groundwork for tomorrow's dreariness, as the promise of rain lurks in the morning shadows. By afternoon, the clouds will weep gently, ushering in a cold rain with temperatures barely reaching 45 degrees. With a striking 90% chance of precipitation, it seems that most of the day will remain enveloped in a somber gray, the gusts of wind rising to 15 miles per hour reminding us that winter is still very much present.\n\nGiven the bleak forecast, one might consider layering up: a warm, waterproof jacket will be essential, paired with scarves and gloves to ward off the chill. Tomorrow\u2019s rain provides a perfect excuse to curl up with a good book in a cozy caf\u00e9, sipping on something warm while watching the world dance past the window, droplets tracing their paths down the glass. Or, if the spirit calls for a more adventurous heart, a short stroll through a museum offers a comforting refuge from the weather, providing warmth and wonder amidst the dampness outside. Embrace the solace in the thunderous sky and allow the simple pleasures of indoor leisure to unfold.",
