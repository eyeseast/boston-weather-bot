A gentle southwest breeze stirs, playful yet palpable, reminding us of the elements\u2019 subtle hand in our day.\n\nAs the sun climbs, you might choose to dress in light fabrics, to let the air caress your skin, while keeping a windbreaker or light sweater nearby for the possible evening showers that loom. As the day turns to dusk, isolated storms may emerge, casting a certain charm over the evening, ideal for quiet strolls under darkening skies, where the scent of rain and earth dances together in the air. With a soft pitter-patter of fresh rain, a trip to a local market or a casual caf\u00e9 to sip on cool drinks becomes a delightful escape.
