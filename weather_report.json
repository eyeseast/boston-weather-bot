    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds over Boston, a soft and muted gray blankets the city, promising a day that mingles the chill of winter with a cautious hint of hope. The forecast beckons a partly sunny disposition as high temperatures inch toward a modest thirty-eight. For those beginning their day, the air carries a crispness that envelopes the skin, a reminder that while spring whispers on the horizon, winter still holds sway. Today\u2019s gentle northeast wind, barely rustling the bare branches, curls around like a fleeting embrace, inviting you to wrap yourself in warm layers \u2013 perhaps a cherished woolen sweater beneath a trusty coat.\n\nAs you navigate the morning, the clouds will linger, casting an inviting cloak over the day\u2019s activities. It is an ideal day for quiet pursuits; perhaps one might meander through the local bookstore, losing track of time among the stacks, or embrace the warmth of a cozy caf\u00e9, wrapped around a steaming mug, watching the world shuffle by. For the more adventurous at heart, a brisk walk along the Charles could awaken the senses, though it would be wise to wear a sturdy pair of boots and a scarf. The evening promises a slow descent into chillier territory, with temperatures dropping toward twenty-three. As twilight falls, the clouds will deepen their embrace, making that cup of tea or a good book a fitting conclusion to the day.",
