    "weather_report": "As the early morning hours envelop Boston, a thick cloak of mist and fog drapes over the city, merging with the low-lying clouds that seep into the streets. The night is still, punctuated only by the soft patter of rain that dances on rooftops and trickles down the city\u2019s edges, a gentle reminder of nature\u2019s presence in the urban sprawl. With temperatures flirting with the chilly side of winter\u2019s whispers, one might find the air crisp, almost biting, despite the rain-soaked landscape. The eastward winds, light yet persistent, carry with them a promise of a damp day ahead.\n\nAs you embark on your Sunday, expect the weather to remain steadfastly gray and drizzly, obscured by the persistent fog and the occasional trickle of rain. The city will hold its breath, as moments of visibility will be precious and fleeting. Dressing in layers would be prudent, perhaps a lightweight waterproof jacket paired with warm, cozy attire beneath. A hat might shield you from the unrelenting light rain, while sturdy shoes will serve you well in navigating the slick streets. Consider retreating to the inviting warmth of a nearby caf\u00e9 to savor a steaming cup of coffee, or perhaps peruse the local bookstores, where the soft lighting beckons you to lose yourself in forgotten tales. Whether you find joy in the comfort of familiar corners or in the thrill of the muted, fog-cloaked streets, this day calls for embracing the subtleties of the quiet moments hidden in the mist.",
