    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Boston, the atmosphere bears a chilly embrace, hinting at the colder hours of the night ahead. Currently, the sky is cloaked in a subtle shroud, with the bright lights of the city flickering against the dark canvas, providing a warm contrast to the drop in temperature, which lingers near the low thirties. The gentle southwest breeze barely stirs, carrying whispers of what lies ahead\u2014a rain-soaked Tuesday that approaches with a resolute certainty.\n\nTomorrow invites the inevitable rain, with clouds thickening as the daylight struggles to break through. As the city awakens to the rhythmic dance of drops on rooftops, the day will unfurl under an overcast blanket. For those navigating this damp backdrop, a sturdy umbrella and a water-resistant coat will serve as wise companions. While the forecast calls for humidity and potential fog, seeking the warmth of a cozy caf\u00e9 or the solace of a good book indoors may provide the perfect balm against the dreariness of the day. Embrace the understated charm of a rainy afternoon; perhaps the hum of the city\u2019s heartbeat can be best felt amidst its embrace.",
