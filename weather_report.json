The morning air is laced with the faintest hint of humidity, hinting at the later arrival of patchy fog and possible rain showers. With temperatures nudging toward the low 70s, it is a comfortable yet uncertain morning, a subtle reminder that change is afoot.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the clouds will linger, creating a tapestry of shifting shades above. Although the sun may make brief appearances, a touch of rain is expected to sweep through before dawn turns to dusk. Today\u2019s ambiance might coax you into light layers\u2014a breezy long sleeve or a sweater for the cooler evening that beckons. With the chance of drizzle and a more subdued skyline, it may be best to contemplate quiet pursuits. Perhaps take a stroll along the Charles River, where reflections dance on the water, or settle in a cozy caf\u00e9, losing yourself in a good book as the world outside shifts with the light. The day invites you to savor simplicity, to relish the moment without the rush, as nature gives its delicate reminder of the beauty in transition.",
