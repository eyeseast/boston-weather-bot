    "weather_report": "In Boston, the evening unfolds beneath a gently fading sky, painted in soft layers of warmth as the sun dips below the horizon. The air, still clinging to the day\u2019s balmy embrace, offers a pleasant respite, inviting you to linger outdoors just a little longer. With temperatures settling comfortably around sixty degrees, a light northwest breeze whispers through the trees, adding a refreshing touch to the tranquil night. The visibility is remarkably clear, enhancing the cityscape's charm and allowing the shimmering lights of the urban skyline to emerge like stars in the twilight.\n\nAs you consider plans for the evening, a light jacket or shawl could be the perfect companion, enveloping you in comfort without weighing you down. It\u2019s an ideal time for a stroll along the Charles River, where the city\u2019s reflections dance upon the water, or perhaps an al fresco dinner at a nearby caf\u00e9, where conversations and laughter mingle in the balmy air. The gradual transition to night invites a sense of relaxation and contemplation\u2014perfect for unwinding with a book in a cozy nook or enjoying the simple pleasure of good company under a blanket of stars.",
