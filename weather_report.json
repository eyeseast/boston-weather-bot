    "weather_report": "As the afternoon light wanes in Boston, a thick curtain of clouds envelops the city, making the day feel cloaked in a gentle melancholy. The air hangs heavy with the promise of rain, a chill whispering through the streets. With the temperature hovering just shy of 39 degrees, the northeast winds rustle the trees with a brisk urgency, hinting at the moisture soon to come. A chance of drizzle lingers in the atmosphere, softening the edges of the skyline and dulling the usually vibrant colors of the urban landscape.\n\nAs evening draws near, the likelihood of rain escalates, with predictions of a dreary drizzle set to accompany the descending twilight. In this setting, one might find it wise to don a warm coat, perhaps layered over a comfortable sweater, while opting for waterproof shoes that can withstand the impending droplets. This is not a day for outdoor excursions; instead, it invites cozying up with a good book in a favorite caf\u00e9, or savoring the warmth of a home-cooked meal as the rain patters softly against the window. Let the day inspire simple pleasures\u2014perhaps an evening stroll under the protective vault of an umbrella, or extending an invitation to friends for a casual board game night, all while the world outside embraces its quiet, muted tone.",
