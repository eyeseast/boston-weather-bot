    "weather_report": "In the quiet embrace of the night, Boston rests under a veil of patchy fog, the air imbued with a slight palpitation of moisture as the temperature dips gently to around fifty degrees. The northeast wind whispers softly, inviting those with a penchant for the ethereal to venture outdoors, albeit with a gentle layer to ward off the chill. As dawn approaches, the scene promises an intricate dance between cloud and rain, with lingering fog casting an enigmatic charm over the morning hours.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the atmospheric mood to thickly cloud and then fray into moments of precipitation, potentially accompanied by the rumble of distant thunder. An invigorating chill will dominate the afternoon, with temperatures hovering near fifty-three degrees. The 90% chance of rain suggests that umbrellas will indeed be useful companions, and the persistence of fog lends an almost cinematic quality to the mundane hustle and bustle of everyday life. Dress accordingly\u2014with layers against the coolness, perhaps a waterproof jacket for those who would explore the city's storied streets or a cozy caf\u00e9 corner for those inclined to bask in the warmth of a hot drink while the world outside blurs in wet brushstrokes. Today invites subtle pleasures: a leisurely stroll through familiar shaded lanes adorned with droplets clinging to foliage, or lingering at a window with a good book, while the rhythmic patter of rain narrates the story of the day.",
