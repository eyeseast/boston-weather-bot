Temperatures linger in the low fifties, a subtle chill settling in with a whisper of a northwestern breeze, suggesting that a sweater or light jacket might be wise for those wandering outside. The intricate interplay of lights twinkles in the darkness, casting a muted glow that reflects the quiet energy of the city.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the promise of a different sort of day emerges. Monday beckons with mostly sunny skies and a high that hints at the warmth of early autumn, around seventy-three degrees. The light north winds will carry a freshness that invites outdoor adventures\u2014perhaps a leisurely stroll through the Public Garden or sipping coffee on a shaded terrace, where one can savor the shifting hues of the season. Layer your attire with a light sweater in the morning, easily shed when the sun takes command. This day carries a sense of optimism, an opportunity to reconnect with the world outside, perhaps even flipping through the pages of a well-loved book as the warmth of the sun embraces you.",
