The sky, a deep canvas of indigo, is only partially veiled by clouds that drift lazily, offering a gentle reminder of the warmest hours that have just passed. A swift breeze carries with it the scents of damp earth and a hint of salt from the harbor, mingling in a way that whispers softly of the day to come. Temperatures are settling into a comfortable lull, perfect for a light jacket should you venture outside.\n\nCome morning, the sun will unfurl its golden rays, casting aside any lingering remnants of rain with a cheerful exuberance. A bright, sunny day awaits, with temperatures climbing towards the pleasant embrace of the upper seventies. The west wind, a constant companion, will ensure that skies remain clear as you navigate your way through the streets, whether you find joy in a meandering walk along the Charles River or a simple coffee visit to your favorite caf\u00e9. Dress in light, breathable fabrics, perhaps donning a light sweater for the morning chill before shedding it as the day warms. You may find solace in small pleasures\u2014an afternoon in the park or a leisurely stroll through the historic neighborhoods, their stories wrapped in the warmth of the sun.",
