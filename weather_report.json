    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds over Boston, a muted palette of soft gray clouds envelops the skyline, casting a gentle shadow over the city. With the air lightly tinged by the promise of drizzle, one can sense the dampness creeping in, a harbinger of the patchy drizzle expected in the early evening. The atmosphere feels both reflective and cozy, a perfect backdrop for a stroll beneath the sprawling tree canopy of one of the city\u2019s many parks. A brisk north wind stirs the leaves, creating a rustle that harmonizes with the steady hum of urban life.\n\nFor those considering their attire, light layers may offer comfort against the chill that lingers in the air, accompanied by the option of a waterproof jacket to ward off the impending drizzle. While the day may not boast the sun\u2019s radiant beams, it carries a certain quiet charm, making it suitable for meandering through art galleries or enjoying a leisurely afternoon in a quiet caf\u00e9, where the aroma of brewing coffee mingles with the soft patter of raindrops outside. Embrace the subtle symphony of the day, where ordinary moments hold the allure of discovery.",
