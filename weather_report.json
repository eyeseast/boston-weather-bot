A whispering southwest wind stirs the stillness, hinting at the promise of a warmer day ahead. Tomorrow, the clouds will part to reveal bursts of sunlight, inviting the city to bask in the warmth that may reach near 80 degrees. The breeze will remain, playful and brisk, making it a perfect day for a leisurely stroll or an outdoor gathering with friends. \n\nAs you plan your day, dress in layers \u2014 light enough to revel in the outdoor warmth, yet prepared for the winds that may greet you. Consider a walk along the waterfront, where the reflections of the city\u2019s twinkling lights dance on the gentle waves. Perhaps a quiet coffee in the shade of a tree, watching the world go by, as cherry blossoms sway lightly overhead. With tomorrow\u2019s pleasant forecast, the city's parks and streets will breathe life anew, inviting you to savor the sweet arrival of spring in the air.",
