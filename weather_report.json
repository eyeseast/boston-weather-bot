    "weather_report": "As twilight descends over Boston, the air feels warm and soft against the skin, hinting at a sultry night ahead. The forecast beckons with a promise of warmth, yet a veil of patchy fog is poised to embrace the city between the restless hours of the early morning. Tonight's low rests gently around 65 degrees, with the breeze barely whispering at 0 to 6 mph, a tender reminder of summer's languid charm. \n\nOn the morrow, Boston will awaken to hints of fog just before dawn, creating a delicate interplay of light and mist that dances gracefully with the sun's rising glow. Expect the day to emerge as a tapestry of vibrant blues and sunny warmth, reaching a welcoming high near 89 degrees. The soft southeast wind will provide just enough comfort to carry the scent of blooming flowers and fresh grass, inviting life outdoors. Given these splendid conditions, attire should lean towards breathable fabrics\u2014light cotton or linen\u2014and perhaps a wide-brimmed hat to shield against the sun's exuberance. As you navigate this day, consider a leisurely stroll during the golden hours, sip a refreshing iced coffee at a local caf\u00e9, or indulge in a peaceful read at one of Boston's quaint parks, wherein the rhythmic rustle of leaves may become the backdrop to your thoughts.",
