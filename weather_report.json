    "weather_report": "In the heart of Boston, a thick shroud of fog weaves through the cityscape, wrapping each corner in a blanket of moisture. This morning, the air carries the scent of impending rain, blending with the chill that lingers just above freezing. The sky, a somber canvas of gray, offers little promise of warmth or clarity. As the hours drift toward midday, the persistent mist will only deepen, ushering in the certainty of rain that lingers like an uninvited guest. The northeast wind sways the naked branches, whispering secrets of winter while delivering a bite that calls for layers.\n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds will part slightly, allowing for moments of moonlight glinting off puddles where rain collected during the day. Temperatures will drop, coaxing those venturing out to bundle up in sweaters and coats, perhaps with a cozy scarf wrapped close against the night air. The gusts of wind will dance once more, a playful reminder of the season. Tonight, though the rain may recede, the lingering dampness may make one yearn for the warmth of home, perhaps flipping through pages of a well-loved book or enjoying a movie that speaks to the comfort of domesticity.",
