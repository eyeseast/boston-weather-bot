    "weather_report": "In Boston this afternoon, the sky dons a cloak of soft gray, hinting at the efforts of rain, with only a gentle chance of showers. The temperature lingers around a comfortable 61 degrees, an invitation for a leisurely stroll along the Charles or a quiet moment by the waterfront. The west wind whispers softly, carrying the scent of the season's blooms juxtaposed against the weathered brick of the city. Though the clouds tease with a glimmer of moisture, the overall atmosphere is one of contemplative calm rather than impending tempest, as the clarion call for rainfall hovers at a mere 30%.\n\nAs evening approaches, expect the chill to settle in, nudging the temperature down to a cozy 47 degrees. The slight chance of rain will remain until 8 PM, lending an air of mystery to the twilight. A light jacket will suit you well; something comforting against the slight bite of the breeze. Perhaps consider meandering through the cobblestone streets, pausing at a favorite caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or simply enjoying the gentle ambiance that cloaks the city as day turns to night. Activities today should lean towards the serene, wrapped in layers that promise both warmth and comfort as the dusk unfolds.",
