    "weather_report": "As afternoon settles over Boston, a swathe of gray clouds drapes the skyline, presenting a somber yet dignified aspect to the city. The air carries a chill with a brisk northwest wind that seems to whisper through the streets, nudging pedestrians toward more layered attire. A high of 63 is anticipated, though it feels briskly cooler under the persistent cloud cover, a reminder of spring's hesitant embrace as summer looms nearby. Tonight, the clouds will linger, the temperature dipping to a comfortable 47, encouraging cozy evenings spent in the solitude of a favorite armchair or perhaps a gathering around warm drinks.\n\nIn this atmospheric tapestry, it\u2019s best to don a light jacket or a woolen sweater, and perhaps a scarf to fend off the wind\u2019s playful bite. Given this tightly knitted weather scene, a leisurely stroll along the Charles River might yield fresh perspectives even as the clouds weave their intricate patterns above. Alternatively, an afternoon spent in the warmth of a nearby caf\u00e9 could offer solace and respite, where the company of good books and warm pastries might soften the day's gray edges.",
