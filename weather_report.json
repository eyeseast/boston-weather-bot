    "weather_report": "In Boston this afternoon, the sky wears a shroud of clouds, thick with promise yet shimmers with the subtle tension of impending drizzle. The high hasn\u2019t quite kissed the comfort of spring, lingering instead at a cool 56 degrees, while a gentle northeast breeze whispers of the ocean\u2019s breath. This curious combination of damp air and muted light sets the stage for a rather contemplative atmosphere, inviting passersby to wander through the cobblestone streets or perhaps find solace in a cozy caf\u00e9, where warm drinks can be cradled in hand.\n\nAs the evening unfurls, the drizzle may come, if only in patches, lingering until the early hours of night. The mercury dips to around 48, urging one to wrap themselves in layers\u2014perhaps a light jacket over a soft sweater, and sturdy shoes to support both the quiet walks under the cloudy canvas, as well as a quick dash inside when the drops begin to fall. With the day winding down, consider a stroll by the river, where the reflections of streetlights create a shimmering path on the water, or perch yourself in a dimly lit bookshop to lose track of time amidst stories that feel just right for the season. The ambiance offers a comforting contrast to the chilly air, inviting the warmth of connection whether with the pages of a book, or the gentle company of a friend.",
