    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Boston, a gentle patch of fog begins to creep in, a soft blanket hovering in shared secrets with the warm air. The day will linger in the memory of those who ventured outside, for the delightful warmth of a 91-degree afternoon has been replaced by a subtle, sultry caress, with a low of around 71. The city, painted in hues of twilight, casts shadows that dance playfully as the northwesterly breeze sighs softly, barely stirring the leaves. Tonight invites serenity, with partially cloaked skies, hinting at the celestial performance yet to unfold as one gazes upward.\n\nTomorrow promises a fill of golden sunshine, beckoning the early birds to emerge. As the sun ascends, its rays will sprinkle vibrancy, perfect for leisurely strolls along the picturesque Charles River or perhaps a visit to a charming caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee partners beautifully with the warmth outside. Dress lightly, embrace breathable fabrics, and allow the anticipation of summer to settle comfortably in your skin. As the whispers of the wind carry laughter and the rustling of leaves, consider a simple indulgence: perhaps just a book in hand, found under the shade of a welcoming tree, where time feels suspended.",
