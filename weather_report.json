    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of the night, Boston rests beneath a cloak of clouds, the air wrapping itself around the city like a whispering embrace. The gentle wind stirs with an intimacy that speaks of comfort, promising a low temperature that nestles around 61 degrees. As dawn approaches, one can sense the subtle anticipation of morning, where the tentative light of day will break through the lingering mist, offering a fresh perspective on the familiar landscape.\n\nAs you rise to greet Friday, the weather unfolds with a welcoming embrace, allowing for those soft beams of sunshine to punctuate the sky. A high near 72 degrees beckons you outdoors, inviting strolls along the Charles River or perhaps a leisurely morning in one of the many quaint caf\u00e9s, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the crisp air. A light jacket may serve you well in the early hours, later surrendered for a more relaxed attire as the day warms, perfect for a shared moment in public parks or a gentle bike ride through the blossoming streets. The day ahead offers an elegant balance, encouraging connection with nature, the cityscape, and perhaps a moment of introspection amidst the gentle pace of summer\u2019s embrace.",
