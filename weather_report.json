The winds, soft yet insistent from the west, invite a hint of movement, suggesting that the day ahead unfolds with promise and unpredictability. \n\nAs the clock strides toward midday, expect scattered rain showers to make an appearance, poised between one and five o'clock. The possibility of light precipitation dances on the edge of a 30 percent chance, teasing the boundary of sun and clouds. A high near 70 awaits, adorned with shimmering moments of half-hearted sunbeams trying to pierce through the persistent clouds. Given this blend of conditions, consider slipping into something light yet layered\u2014a comfortable shirt complemented by a light jacket\u2014preparing for both the warmth of the sun and the occasional chill of a shower. Plans might gravitate towards a leisurely stroll through the historic streets, perhaps punctuated by a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of coffee mingles with the promise of an interesting book.
