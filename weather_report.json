    "weather_report": "As night envelops Boston, a gentle shroud of patchy fog begins to weave its way through the city, softening the edges of buildings and blurring streetlights into hazy pools of light. The warmth of the evening lingers, with temperatures settling around a comfortable 68 degrees. It's a night that invites you to take a languorous stroll, wrapped in a light jacket that shields against the coolness creeping in, while the soft whisper of a southwest breeze carries a hint of summer's lingering warmth.\n\nCome morning, the fog will yield to the sun, revealing a vibrant blue sky that promises to warm the city to a near-scorching 91 degrees. A gentle north wind may keep the heat from being oppressive, but the allure of a bright day after this hazy night calls for comfortable attire\u2014perhaps a breathable cotton shirt and light shorts, perfect for a day out. The park, the waterfront, or even a hidden caf\u00e9 terrace will welcome those seeking the simplest pleasures of life. As you navigate the unfolding day, consider the charm of a leisurely visit to a local bookstore or a quiet afternoon in the shade of trees, embracing the beauty of summer in the city.",
