The temperature hovers around a crisp 21 degrees, with a gentle north wind barely stirring the air. Tonight feels like the calm before tomorrow's celebratory daylight; its coolness offers a reminder of the season's depth, yet the absence of fog allows the city\u2019s twinkling lights to manifest like stars upon the earth.\n\nOn Christmas Day, a promise of sunshine awaits, with a high nearing 32 degrees. The northwest wind may offer a bit more vigor, yet it is manageable enough to not deter those with a spirit for exploration. Dress in layers, perhaps a cozy sweater beneath a warm coat, complemented by a woolen scarf and sturdy boots\u2014these preparations will ensure comfort as you traverse the city. As the warmth of the holiday envelops the community, consider a stroll through the Public Garden, a walk along the Charles River, or perhaps a visit to one of Boston\u2019s charming cafes, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the excitement of the day. The city's historical marvels stand ready to be re-discovered, and there\u2019s beauty in the simple moments shared with loved ones on this festive occasion.",
