    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Boston, a gentle haze mingles with the warmth of an early summer day. The sun casts a soft light, illuminating the city while a whispering east wind stirs the air, hinting at the promise of adventure. High temperatures hover near a comfortable 81 degrees, though the atmosphere carries a touch of smoke, altering the skyline into a gentle watercolor blur. This haziness may invite thoughts of a leisurely stroll\u2014perhaps along the Charles River, where the reflections shimmer lazily on the water\u2019s surface, or amidst the lush greenery of the Boston Common, where tree canopies provide respite from the sun's rays.\n\nAs twilight approaches, evening will unfold with a comforting embrace, the clouds retreating to expose a patchwork of stars. A low of around 61 degrees will greet you, allowing for the pleasant camaraderie of friends gathered for an outdoor dinner\u2014perhaps at a charming patio where laughter punctuates the warm air. Dressing lightly, with layers at the ready, will keep you at ease through this transition. Under the serene canvas of the sky, take the opportunity to enjoy the simple pleasures: savoring gelato from a nearby shop, or listening to the hum of heartfelt conversations as the day draws to a close.",
