    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Boston, the city basks in the aftermath of a glorious day, now transitioning to a gentle calm. The fleeting warmth of a day that flirted with summer's embrace produces a soft, lingering heat, while the north wind stirs lightly, whispering through the trees. Tonight, the sky holds a promise of clarity, painted in soft hues of indigo and amber, with temperatures sliding toward a comfortable 57. It is the perfect invitation to step outside, to stroll along the harbor, or perhaps settle on a friendly patio with a warm drink in hand. \n\nLooking ahead, Saturday dawns with the sun poised to greet the day. Expect the golden rays to spill over the horizon, warming the air to a delightful high near 79, all while a gentle northeast breeze continues to tickle the leaves. Tomorrow beckons with the allure of outdoor gatherings, leisurely picnics, or a simple adventure through Boston\u2019s historic streets. Dress comfortably in layers for the warmth to come, perhaps a light shirt with a favorite jacket tucked away, ready for the evening\u2019s embrace. As the city buzzes with life, it is a splendid moment to appreciate the unfolding day and all its possibilities.",
