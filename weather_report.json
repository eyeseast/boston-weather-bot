    "weather_report": "As night blankets Boston, the city remains cloaked in a gentle veil of clouds, with a soft, warm breeze whispering through the streets. The temperature nestles comfortably around 67 degrees, promising a sultry embrace as dawn approaches. In a few hours, the sky will awaken with the potential for fleeting rain showers, particularly around midday, but for now, the atmosphere holds a quiet anticipation, a lull before the forthcoming warmth of a summer Sunday.\n\nAs the sun begins its ascent, expect the day to illuminate Boston with moments of brilliance, bringing a high temperature that dances near 92, tempered only slightly by a whisper of southwest winds. Despite the chance of afternoon thunderstorms, the unfolding hours suggest a predominantly sunny disposition, urging residents to venture outdoors. Those embarking on errands or leisurely strolls may favor lightweight fabrics, perhaps a breathable linen shirt paired with comfortable shorts and a wide-brimmed hat to shield themselves from the sun's ardent caress. A light jacket might be useful later, but in the warmth of the day, one could delight in exploring local parks or savoring an ice cream at a favorite caf\u00e9, capturing the essence of a summer\u2019s day in Boston.",
