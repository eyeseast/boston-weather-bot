    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Boston, the sun reigns supreme, bathing the city in warmth that draws people outdoors, eager to embrace the sultry air. The temperature hovers just shy of 96 degrees, while the heat index matches it, presenting an inviting intensity that speaks of summer\u2019s peak. With a gentle southwest breeze at play, the atmosphere remains lively yet charged, providing a respite from the heat even as the sun bathes the world in a golden glow. As the afternoon lazily drifts toward evening, the sky holds a few fluffy clouds, mere wisps that dance against a backdrop of brilliant blue.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the city anticipates a slight chance of rain, seemingly coy with only a 20% likelihood of showers past 5 AM. For the evening hours, the temperature will ease to around 70, inviting a shift in atmosphere as the vibrant colors of dusk take over. Given these conditions, it may be best to don light, breathable clothing, allowing for comfort in the heat while keeping a light jacket handy for the cooler evening air. The day\u2019s warmth inspires leisurely strolls along the waterfront, perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 to enjoy an evening iced beverage, watching the light evolve until it softly succumbs to night. This blend of sun, warmth, and the possibility of rain beckons simple joys, nudging residents to savor the languor of summer\u2019s embrace.",
