    "weather_report": "As dusk settles over Boston, a veil of clouds gently obscures the horizon, wrapping the city in a soft, muted palette. The day has woven a tapestry of warmth, but the evening whispers of humidity lingering, urging a light jacket or perhaps a cozy sweater for those venturing out. At this hour, the chance of rain flirts with the air, teasing but not fully committing, with only the distant murmur of a breeze to accompany the low hum of nighttime activity. The streets, painted with the soft glow of streetlights, offer a serene backdrop to evening wanderings or quiet contemplation on the edge of the Charles.\n\nLooking toward tomorrow, the sun is poised to reclaim its authority with promises of a bright day, brushing away the twilight\u2019s shadows and revealing a clear, inviting sky. It beckons one to enjoy a leisurely stroll through Boston\u2019s historic streets or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where one can savor a warm cup while watching the world greet the day. But tonight, as the city settles into a hushed rhythm, the atmosphere invites relaxation\u2014perfect for cuddling up with a book or indulging in a Netflix binge from the comfort of home, embracing the gentle close of summer as it slips into the cool embrace of fall.",
