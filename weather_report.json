    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Boston, the sun graces the sky with a warm embrace, casting a golden light over the city as it rises to a comfortable high. The southeast wind whispers gently, adding a hint of coolness that tempers the heat, perfect for an afternoon spent roaming city parks or along the picturesque waterfront. As the day unfolds, the atmosphere remains clear, promising clarity both in sight and spirit.\n\nAs the sun dips below the horizon tonight, expect a continuation of this serenity. The stars will peek through a canvas of mostly clear skies, inviting evening strolls or casual gatherings on rooftops. The warmth lingers, encouraging light attire\u2014perhaps a soft cotton shirt paired with comfortable shorts or casual trousers. Consider a light sweater or shawl should the night turn unexpectedly cozy. With these pleasant conditions, a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a leisurely coffee or a small gathering with friends outdoors would be delightful. Let the gentle evening unfold with ease.",
