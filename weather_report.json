    "weather_report": "As evening envelops Boston, the city is cloaked in the soft embrace of falling snow, a gentle reminder of winter\u2019s grasp. The air is sharp yet invigorating, with temperatures hovering around a frigid twenty degrees. Northeastern winds sweep through the streets, whispering tales of the chill that lingers just outside the warmth of home. With a 100% chance of precipitation, expect the snow to accumulate, painting a delicate layer of white over everything it touches. Tonight's weather, while certainly not for the faint of heart, possesses a quiet beauty, ideal for those who find solace in the stillness of a snowy night.\n\nAs Monday dawns, the snow continues its serenade, creating an atmosphere that may seem dreary to some but enchanting to others. The temperature will dip slightly, giving way to a high near twenty-nine degrees but falling again by afternoon. The subdued gray skies provide a perfect backdrop for a leisurely indoor day, perfect for wrapping oneself in a soft blanket with a steaming cup of coffee or tea, indulging in books or perhaps a movie marathon. Dress warmly, layering sensibly for both comfort and mobility\u2014think thick scarves and boots that crunch on fresh snow. It's a day for quiet reflection and cozying up indoors or, if feeling adventurous, a stroll outside to appreciate the transformed landscape.",
