    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, a persistent drizzle accentuates the overcast sky, wrapping the city in a blanket of gray. With temperatures hovering around a modest 45 degrees, the air turns brisk, stirred by a north wind that adds an edge to the dampness. The chance of rain looms large\u2014about 80%\u2014suggesting that umbrellas are not just a precaution but rather an essential accessory today. As twilight approaches, the chance of rain lingers into the evening, with clouds drawing ever nearer towards nightly obscurity, while temperatures dip to the high 30s.\n\nIn this kind of weather, comfort reigns supreme. A sturdy waterproof jacket combined with a soft scarf will shield against the chill, and a pair of well-worn boots will prove vital, especially if you find yourself traversing puddles that dot the city streets. Activities may call you indoors; perhaps peruse a local caf\u00e9, savoring a warm beverage while watching life unfold through fogged-up windows, or seek refuge in a nearby bookstore where the pages of novels can transport you far beyond today's gloomy embrace. The weather does not appear inviting for a stroll along the Charles, but it raises the perfect opportunity for quiet reflection or a leisurely gathering with friends.",
