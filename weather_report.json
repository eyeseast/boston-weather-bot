    "weather_report": "Today in Boston, the atmosphere is steeped in the kind of gentle gloom that envelops early spring days. As the clock ticks into afternoon, a steady whisper of rain lingers\u2014threatening to entwine with the soft fog creeping through the city\u2019s corners. The skies remain overcast, dressed in heavy clouds that obscure the sun, heralding a high near 40 degrees. A cool northeast breeze weaves its way through the streets, inviting you to pull an extra layer close against the chill. \n\nAs day whispers into night, a slight chance of rain continues its delicate dance with reality, while the fog thickens, possibly cloaking the city until the early hours. With the low edging toward 36, snug layers become your trusted companions\u2014perhaps a warm sweater beneath a rain-resistant jacket, accompanied by sturdy shoes. This weather, while not the most inviting, offers an opportunity for quiet reflection; a warm caf\u00e9 with a good book might be the perfect haven, or a stroll through the misty streets can reveal the city\u2019s understated beauty. All the while, let the rain be the score to your day, a rhythmic backdrop to life's simplest luxuries.",
