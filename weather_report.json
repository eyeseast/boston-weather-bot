    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the atmosphere dances between the crispness of early spring and the lingering chill of winter. This afternoon reveals a mostly sunny day, where the sky stretches wide with soft, cottony clouds, their forms gracefully rolling away into the horizon. The air carries a refreshing touch, aided by a gentle south wind that hums softly through the streets, lifting spirits as it sweeps past. As twilight approaches, the clouds will gather, hinting at the quiet chill that will seep in with the night. The temperature is expected to settle into a cool embrace, inviting you to wrap yourself in layers as you venture out.\n\nAs you plan your afternoon, a stroll along the Charles River could provide a moment of peace, with the calm waters reflecting the faded warmth of the sun. Dress warmly, perhaps in your favorite wool sweater or a sturdy jacket, complemented by a scarf that shields against the evening cool. A foam cup of coffee from a local caf\u00e9 could accompany you, inviting you to take a moment on a bench and enjoy the beauty of fleeting winter into spring. As you move through the day, let the simplicity of these moments wash over you, for there is beauty in the quiet transitions around us.",
