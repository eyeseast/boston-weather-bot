    "weather_report": "As the night unfurls over Boston, a quiet chill hangs in the air, accompanied by the weight of clouds looming above. The temperature hovers around five degrees, with a slight whisper of wind that transforms the atmosphere into something sharper, making it feel as if it dips even further into the realm of the cold. Snow showers are a possibility before the stroke of one, dispersing the stillness of the evening, but for now, the city is wrapped in a muted glow, the scattered lights twinkling against the darkened canvas. \n\nTomorrow brings a shift\u2014a promise of sunshine piercing through the thick gray, inviting a high near twenty-three. This juxtaposition of warmth and cold will create a crisp morning, the kind where steam rises from warm drinks held tightly in gloved hands. On a day like this, layering is essential; a heavy coat, perhaps a knitted scarf, and thick gloves should be the attire of choice to embrace the elements. For those who venture out, a winter walk along the waterfront or a leisurely stroll through the intricate paths of the Common might be the perfect way to celebrate the day. The clarity of the afternoon sun promises to lift spirits, an ideal backdrop for a casual meetup with friends at a nearby caf\u00e9, where conversations can flow as freely as the warm beverages that sustain them.",
