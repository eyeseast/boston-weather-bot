With temperatures dipping to the low thirties, a cozy layering of clothing will serve well\u2014think of a warm scarf wrapped snugly and a light jacket that can be easily shrugged off as the heat of the day takes over. The quiet thrum of the city below patiently hums, a tableau of twinkling lights against the dark canvas of the sky, hinting at the bustle that breathes life into its streets by day.\n\nLooking ahead, Monday welcomes a gradual shift, as clouds gather on the horizon and the promise of rain flirts with the afternoon's sun. The air will be fresh, and while it may not be the sunniest of days, there's a sense of optimism in the softer hues of a partly sunny sky. As the temperature climbs towards sixty and then takes a step back, it may be worth embracing an adaptable wardrobe, perhaps with an umbrella tucked away\u2014just in case. Whether it be a leisurely stroll along the Esplanade or a visit to one of Boston's cherished cafes, the day offers a gentle reminder to savor the nuances of the shifting season, balancing the chill with warm-hearted gatherings and quiet moments within the city's embrace.",
