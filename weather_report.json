    "weather_report": "As the early hours settle quietly over Boston, the city lies beneath a muted veil of clouds, a dimly lit canvas softened by the soft embrace of an emerging night. The temperature drifts chillily around ten degrees, urging you to wrap yourself warmly in layers that can hold both warmth and a sense of comfort. Perhaps a well-loved woolen sweater shielded by a sturdy coat would suit the temperament of the evening, allowing for leisurely strolls or cozy gatherings indoors, free from the biting cold.\n\nFriday brings the promise of overcast skies, a continuation of this tranquil aesthetic, with temperatures nudging towards a brisk twenty-nine during the day. The north wind whispers softly, hinting at a day that settles into a pleasant stroll down emblematic streets, windows glistening with the reflections of city life. Take your time\u2014state parks beckon for a peaceful retreat, while caf\u00e9s offer warm drinks that invite comfort. With such subdued beauty wrapping the city, consider a mid-morning visit to a local bookstore or a glance at art galleries where the atmosphere invites reflection and discovery. Today is less about grand gestures and more about savoring the simple joys that make everyday life rich.",
