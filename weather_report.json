    "weather_report": "Under the blanket of a muted gray sky, Boston quietly weathers an afternoon steeped in cloudiness, hinting at the chill that lies just beyond the horizon. The air is crisp, with a gentle westward breeze whispering against the skin, offering just a taste of warmth amidst the promise of colder night. As you step outside, there\u2019s an inviting stillness, beckoning one to embrace the chilly charm of the city. \n\nTonight, the sky will yield to a delicate partial clarity, though temperatures will slip down, ushering in wind chills that may make it feel significantly cooler\u2014nestling at the edge of frost. It would be wise to don layers: a snug scarf wound around your neck, sturdy gloves, and perhaps a well-loved coat that retains the warmth of many winter evenings. As the day wanes, consider a stroll through the quiet streets, perhaps stopping by a cozy caf\u00e9 to indulge in a warm drink, savoring the comfort it brings as the world outside grows quieter and darker. Alternatively, a gentle walk along the harbor might reveal the beauty of a city cloaked in winter's embrace, with the distant lights twinkling like stars fallen to earth.",
