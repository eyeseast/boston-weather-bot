A brisk southeast breeze brushes past, holding whispers of warmth as the city prepares to transition into a chillier evening. As day gives way to night, expect the clouds to thicken, heralding the arrival of rain later on\u2014a somber promise of precipitation that may dampen the air but not the spirits of the city\u2019s inhabitants.\n\nWith temperatures reaching a mild 50 degrees, the day invites you to don layers that blend comfort with readiness. A light jacket paired with a cozy scarf will serve well, preparing you for the temperatures that will dip into the 30s tonight. As the evening encroaches, those seeking leisure might consider a quiet stroll through a local park, listening to the rustle of leaves as they dance with the impending drizzle. Alternatively, finding solace in a nearby caf\u00e9, sipping on a steaming cup of tea while watching the world retreat into the comfort of their homes, could be a delightful way to embrace the night. Whatever your choice, Boston\u2019s charming mosaic continues to inspire, even under a cloak of clouds.",
