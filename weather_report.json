    "weather_report": "As the sun rises on this warm August day in Boston, the air carries a hint of humidity, promising an unsteady mix of sun and clouds. Morning fog lingers, veiling the skyline in a soft gray embrace, casting a serene yet expectant mood over the city. By midday, the clouds will part just enough to allow glimpses of sunlight, coaxing temperatures up toward a sultry 92 degrees. There's a whisper of heat in the air, as heat index values may nudge higher, making it feel like a tropical getaway right in the heart of New England. \n\nAs twilight approaches, the atmosphere may shift again, bringing with it a chance of showers and the distant rumble of thunderstorms, a reminder that summer\u2019s grip can still surprise us. Residents will find the evening much cooler, perhaps inviting a light jacket to stave off the chill after the day\u2019s warmth. A casual stroll along the Charles River, taking in the city\u2019s lights reflecting on the water, might be a lovely way to embrace the changing weather. Alternatively, finding a cozy spot at a local caf\u00e9, watching the sporadic raindrops dance against the window, can turn an ordinary night into something special. Dress lightly for the daytime warmth, but keep an umbrella close for those unforeseen moments of summer\u2019s whimsy.",
