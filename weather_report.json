    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches over Boston, the city is swathed in a gentle cloak of clouds, casting a muted but tranquil glow upon the waking world. The air is cool, a soft and soothing reminder of the Northeast\u2019s charm, where the temperature settles around a refreshing 54 degrees. A light breeze whispers from the northeast, hinting at the promise of partly sunny skies as the sun ascends to greet the day. The atmosphere holds a pleasant weight, as the clouds hang above, suggesting that while the morning may be slow to brighten, the potential for a welcoming afternoon lies just ahead.\n\nAs the hours unfold, one might consider a leisurely morning stroll through the quieter streets of the city, perhaps clutching a warm cup of coffee to combat the lingering coolness. Layering will serve well in this temperate embrace; a light sweater or jacket will be the perfect companion against the cooler morning air. As the sun rises higher, inviting a mild warmth into the day, an afternoon exploring the vibrant parks or quaint bookstores could be splendid. Engaging with the gentle hum of the city might unearth the simple pleasures of a Sunday: a peaceful read by the Charles River or a casual lunch at a tucked-away cafe. The promise of partly sunny skies will eventually transform the landscape, inviting a blend of joy and respite in the heartbeat of Boston's Sunday.",
