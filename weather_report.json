    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Boston, the skies remain mostly clear, wrapping the city in a stillness that is only occasionally interrupted by the soft whisper of a gentle west wind. The air carries the crispness of a winter evening, a reminder of the chill that has settled in, with the temperature hovering around a brisk 14 degrees. The urban tapestry glimmers faintly against the dark backdrop, each light a small beacon of warmth amidst the enveloping coolness.\n\nLooking ahead to Tuesday, there is promise in the air. The sun will peek through with a decidedly more cheerful disposition, casting a light that will warm the soul, if not the skin, with temperatures anticipated to rise near 34 degrees. This gentle rise in warmth, coupled with a modest southwest breeze, offers an invitation to embrace the day. For those venturing out, layers will be your best ally; a snug coat over a soft sweater, perhaps paired with a scarf to ward off any lingering chill. As for activities, consider taking a leisurely stroll through one of Boston's quieter parks or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 to savor a warm beverage while watching life drift by. It's a day marked by the simple joys of winter, a time to relish the beauty around while wrapped comfortably against the cold.",
