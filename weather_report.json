    "weather_report": "As the night drapes itself over Boston, a blanket of clouds lingers softly above, hinting at a chill in the air. With temperatures settling around 18 degrees, the breeze carries a briskness that cuts through the evening stillness, whispering promises of a frosty night ahead. There\u2019s an intriguing serenity to the current scene, marked by the glistening lights of the city casting a warm glow against the darkened backdrop, a reminder that even in the depths of winter, life pulses vibrantly beneath the surface.\n\nTomorrow, as dawn approaches, the sun will begin to shyly peek through the clouds, escalating to a rather pleasant day with highs nudging toward a striking 31 degrees. The northwest winds will weave through the streets, bringing a clarity to the air that feels both invigorating and inviting. Ideal preparations for this day may include wrapping oneself in layers \u2014 think a cozy knit sweater beneath a solid coat, paired with sturdy boots to brave the briskness. With a touch of sunshine expected, wandering through local parks or visiting a nearby caf\u00e9 sounds delightful; perhaps a quiet morning spent with a warm drink would suit this brightening winter day perfectly.",
