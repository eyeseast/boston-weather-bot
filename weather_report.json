    "weather_report": "As dawn gently breaks over Boston, the city stirs under a serene blanket of partly cloudy skies, a tranquil precursor to a beautiful midweek day. The temperature lingers in the cool embrace of the morning, around 48 degrees, prompting a light jacket or cardigan to ward off the briskness that dances in the air. The soft northwest breeze whispers through the streets, carrying the fresh promise of a sun-filled day.\n\nBy midday, the sun will climb higher, casting vibrant light across the city, coaxing out warm hues as temperatures rise to a comfortable 71 degrees. The day beckons outdoor pursuits that evoke simple joys \u2013 perhaps a stroll along the Charles River, where the sunlight shimmers on the water, or a quiet moment spent in one of Boston\u2019s lush parks, where flowers begin to unfold in spring's embrace. As the workday draws to a close and the sun dips towards the horizon, the golden hour invites reflection, making it an ideal time for unwinding over a book on a sun-kissed bench or sampling the culinary delights at a local caf\u00e9. Dress comfortably yet warmly, layered in preparation for the evening's coolness, and embrace the vibrant yet peaceful rhythms of the city on this delightful day.",
