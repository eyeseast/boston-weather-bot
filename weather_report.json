The air\u2014fresh yet tinged with moisture\u2014brushes against your skin, whispering secrets of the night ahead. As the clock ticks towards midnight, expect this fog to thicken, carrying with it the rhythmic patter of raindrops, a soothing lullaby that lingers in the air well into the early hours. Temperatures dip to a chilly 43 degrees, and while the night may feel damp, a light layer will shield you from the wind\u2019s subtle bites.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Friday, the fog may yet hold tight, teasing glimpses of clarity as the sun struggles to break through. Expect patchy fog to linger, mingling with the scattered remnants of rain, which may sprinkle down sporadically throughout the morning. The day promises to be cloudy, with a high shy of 50 degrees. The gusts from the northwest will playfully tug at your attire, reminding you to bundle up\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater layered beneath a water-resistant jacket would suffice. With the city dressed in subdued hues, consider venturing to a quiet caf\u00e9, where the steam from your drink mirrors the soft clouds outside. It\u2019s a day for reflective moments, perhaps a gentle stroll along the Charles, taking in the muted beauty of a Boston morning where the promise of renewal whispers through the damp air.",
