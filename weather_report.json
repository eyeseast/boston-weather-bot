    "weather_report": "In Boston this morning, a muted gray sky drapes over the city, hinting at the impending snow that will likely blanket everything by early afternoon. As you glance out, the air holds a certain weight, hanging thick with the promise of fog and gentle, persistent snowfall. The temperature, finding its way around a chilly 36 degrees, will wrap the day in a brisk embrace, inviting layered garments that can ward off the chill. A scarf, perhaps in a jaunty color, will guard your neck against the brisk south wind that whispers through the streets.\n\nAs evening approaches, snow will have made its quiet entrance, accompanied by a veil of fog that renders the cityscape almost dreamlike. With temperatures dropping to a frosty 30 degrees, the mix of snow and rain will dance lightly through the air, offering a soft spectacle as twilight descends. For those venturing out, a water-resistant coat and sturdy boots will serve well, protecting against the damp underfoot. Perhaps a casual stroll through a nearby park will do you good, where the serene ambiance allows for a moment of reflection amidst the wintery scene. Nestle into the evening with a steaming cup of cocoa, watching the snow kiss the world outside, and let the gentle hush of the snowfall wrap around you like a comforting embrace.",
