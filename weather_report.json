    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Boston, a mild haze wraps the city in a cloak of drizzle and fog, transforming familiar streets into ethereal paths lined with shimmering, damp air. The night holds a coolness that whispers promises of a brisk morning, as the temperature hovers around the mid-thirties. A gentle southwest breeze adds a soft touch, nudging the fog along, veiling the outlines of landmarks in a shroud of gray.\n\nThe dawn may unfold gradually, marked by continued drizzles and patches of fog hanging in the air, painting the landscape with a muted palette. An exhilarating sense of mystery lingers, inviting morning strollers to embrace the mist, perhaps warming their hands around a cup of coffee from one of the local caf\u00e9s that beckon with the warmth of light and laughter. For those venturing outdoors, it\u2019s wise to don layers\u2014a cozy sweater beneath a sturdy coat, accompanied by a scarf to ward off the chill. As the day wears on, the clouds will dominate the sky, with a measly chance of rain offering a delicate reminder of the autumn season still lingering. In these muted, damp conditions, the city invites leisurely activities; perhaps a quiet visit to the bookstore, perusing the shelves for undiscovered literary treasures, or simply taking a stroll through the quiet, fog-drenched parks, where every whisper of the breeze tells a tale of solitude and introspection.",
