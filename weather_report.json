    "weather_report": "Tonight in Boston unfolds under a partially cloaked sky, where the cool embrace of temperatures dipping to around 19 creates a crisp atmosphere. A gentle westerly breeze stirs the stillness, hinting at the clarity of the night, though the horizon remains slightly softened by drifting clouds. The scene, marked by twinkling city lights against the night, offers a sense of tranquility; it\u2019s perfect for a quiet stroll through the neighborhood, where the evening stillness wraps warmly around you.\n\nTomorrow promises a transformation as the sun takes its rightful place in the sky, bringing an inviting warmth with highs reaching near 32. The fortifying west winds at a gentle pace will accompany a delightful sunny day, the kind that washes away the remnants of winter gloom. As the city awakens and the light draws out the vibrant life of Boston, a pair of layers will serve well\u2014a comfortable sweater or light jacket, perhaps even a wool hat, might be welcomed as you venture out. Ideal activities beckon; perhaps meandering through the Public Garden or exploring local cafes, where conversations blend with the aroma of fresh coffee, creating a perfect backdrop for reading or just indulging in simple moments of joy amidst the bustle.",
