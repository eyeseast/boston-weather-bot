The gentle northwest wind will dance through the streets, bringing invigorating gusts that may ruffle the hair and lift spirits.\n\nTonight's conditions suggest a comfortable outing. A light jacket or a cozy sweater would complement the chill nicely as one might stroll along the Charles River or perhaps find solace in a quiet caf\u00e9, savoring a cup of something warm. As the sun breaks free on Sunday, it presents an opportunity to bask in the delightful weather \u2014 a perfect occasion for a leisurely walk in the Public Garden or perhaps an afternoon spent exploring the shops along Newbury Street, where the bright sun casts playful shadows across the bustling scene. The clarity of the day invites one to embrace the outdoors, making it ideal for simple pleasures and unhurried exploration.",
