The temperature is settling down to a brisk chill, around 22 degrees, with a substantial west wind whispering through the streets, occasionally gusting to create an unwelcome bite in the air. Those venturing out will want to layer up, perhaps donning a woolen scarf and a comfortable jacket to fend off the evening's crisp embrace. \n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, the clouds may thin slightly to reveal a mix of sun, offering a glimpse of warmth amid the chill. Temperatures will climb towards a high of 31, with the winds continuing their dance, adding to the ever-constant rhythm of winter in the city. Sunday presents an opportunity for simple pleasures: a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the steam from a warm drink can fortify against the lingering cold. It promises to be a day that, while brisk, encourages a gentle exploration of Boston's charm, where even in the chill, warmth can be found in the heart of the city.",
