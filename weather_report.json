The night feels contemplative, with temperatures settling in around a cool 48 degrees. The south wind carries whispers of a warmer day ahead, as the forecast breathes promise into Monday's sunshine\u2014where the fog will melt away by morning, giving space to vibrant blue skies and temperatures rising to a comfortable 74. \n\nFor those aiming to venture outdoors, the invitation to partake in a simple stroll through the urban tapestry of Boston beckons. Dress in light layers to navigate the transition from cool night air to the warmth of sun-kissed afternoons. Perhaps clutch a warm cup of coffee while meandering through the Common, or explore the quiet nooks of cobblestone streets as the city awakens. As each ray of sunlight pierces through the remnants of fog, take a moment to savor the soft embrace of autumn drifting in.",
