    "weather_report": "As the night hangs heavily over Boston, a soft veil of clouds cloaks the city in a muted embrace, lending an air of quiet anticipation to the early hours. With temperatures settling near a crisp 25 degrees, the chill in the air is palpable, whispering of the frost that dances just above the ground. The gentle north wind, barely stirring, adds a hint of sharpness to the stillness, promising a serene reprieve as the world slowly shifts towards dawn.\n\nCome Thursday, the skyline will awaken to the warmth of sunlight breaking through the gray shroud. Anticipating a high near 38, the sun\u2019s rays will cast a golden glow against the frosted rooftops. It may be wise to layer up this morning, perhaps a thick sweater accompanied by a tucked-in scarf, as you embark on the day's journey. Whether a calm stroll along the riverbank or a quiet moment spent sipping coffee at a favorite caf\u00e9, the day unfurls with the potential for both reflection and connection. Engage with the unfolding beauty of an urban landscape reawakened, all while embracing the lingering chill that reminds us winter's grip has not yet fully released.",
