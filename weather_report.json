Current temperatures hover in the chill of early spring, promising a low that feels nippy against the skin. With a 50% chance of rainfall lingering in the early hours, the sky is cloaked in a heavy, mostly cloudy veil, whispering of moisture yet to come. A north wind carries a briskness that cuts through the stillness, hinting at the vibrancy of life that stirs below.\n\nThe day unfolds with a promise of rain beginning shortly after sunrise, transforming into a shroud of patchy fog that blurs the skyline. By midday, expect the world to be softened\u2014ambiguous contours emerge through the low-hanging mist. The high may struggle to breach the low forties, making it a day where layering is essential. Consider a light raincoat or an umbrella for the intermittent showers, pairing it with something warm to wrap around your core. It\u2019s a day well-suited to quiet endeavors\u2014perhaps a cozy visit to a local caf\u00e9 where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee dances in the air, or a leisurely stroll through the streets, with the world around you painted in watercolors of uncertainty. Embrace the embrace of softness in these early spring days, as rain brings life, and fog encourages reflection.",
