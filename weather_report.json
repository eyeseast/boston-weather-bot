The temperatures are comfortably warm, cradled around 65 degrees, while a subtle breeze stirs from the southeast, whispering promises of the day to come. The fog, a delicate veil, might linger until the early morning hours, giving way eventually to the sun\u2019s tentative rays, which will break through, casting the city in shades of gold and blue as the day unfolds.\n\nThe forecast beckons a transformation by midmorning, with patchy fog dissipating to reveal a somewhat playful mix of clouds and sun. Expect warmth to rise, reaching into the low 80s, a gentle kiss of summer that invites you outdoors. Dress in layers: a light shirt welcomes the warm embrace of the day, but bringing along a light jacket or cardigan will offer comfort against the lingering coolness of the morning. Perhaps take a stroll along the Esplanade, where the Charles River glistens, or explore one of the city\u2019s many hidden caf\u00e9s, where you might sip on freshly brewed coffee while indulging in a quiet moment, admiring the bustling yet serene rhythm of Boston waking up. This day holds the promise of warmth and gentle breezes, making it perfect for a leisurely outing that is both invigorating and calming\u2014a reminder of the simple pleasures summer can provide.",
