    "weather_report": "As night envelops Boston, the city lies beneath a blanket of mostly clear skies, the serenity punctuated by the gentle rustle of a westward wind. With temperatures dipping to a brisk 29 degrees, the air carries a bite that speaks of winter's embrace. In this tranquil moment, one can almost taste the sharpness of the cold, each breath releasing a ghostly plume. The city\u2019s lights twinkle like distant stars, offering warmth in their flicker as they illuminate the roads that wind through its heart.\n\nTomorrow promises to greet us with a sun-drenched dawn, where sunny dispositions will reign over the day. The high will flirt with 43 degrees, a modest rise that invites Boston's residents outdoors. The gentle winds, a whisper compared to tonight\u2019s chill, will make the air feel surprisingly pleasant as the sun stretches its golden arms across the landscape. It\u2019s a day made for leisurely strolls along the cobblestone streets or perhaps a quiet afternoon enjoying a warm beverage in a cozy caf\u00e9. Dress warmly, with layers that allow freedom of movement, yet shield against the lingering cold. A well-fitted scarf could very well be your closest companion as you embrace the day\u2019s promise and venture forth into the inviting embrace of winter's sparkle.",
