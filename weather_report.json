    "weather_report": "In Boston, a gentle afternoon unfolds, the sky displaying a soft palette of blue and white, teasing the promise of warmth as it approaches a delightful seventy degrees. The light breeze, whispering with an easterly caress, hints at a day that gently lures you outside, where the air feels crisp yet inviting. As daylight settles, the sky morphs into a mostly cloudy canvas, draping the city in a cozy embrace as the temperature eases to a serene fifty-seven, a perfect backdrop for evening strollers beneath a veil of soft clouds.\n\nAs you navigate through this transitional day, a light jacket or a cozy sweater may serve well in the cooler hours to come. Conditions invite a leisurely jaunt through the park, perhaps a quiet moment spent on a bench to watch the world go by, or a stroll along the waterfront as the sun sinks gracefully. Maybe a visit to a favorite caf\u00e9 is in order, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with idle chatter, offering a refuge as the day wanes. There\u2019s an understated beauty to this day, beckoning you to savor both its warmth and its gentle turn towards evening.",
