    "weather_report": "In Boston, this afternoon unfolds under an inviting expanse of azure skies, where the sun bathes the city in a warm embrace, promising a high of 25 degrees. A gentle northwest breeze stirs the air, creating a refreshing backdrop to the tranquil beauty of the day. Tonight, the celestial display continues, with the stars emerging in a mostly clear sky, as temperatures dip to around 9 degrees. Though cool, the evening\u2019s calm is a perfect opportunity to revel in the crispness that defines a New England winter.\n\nAs you step outside, consider layering elegantly\u2014a cozy sweater paired with a light jacket will suffice to ward off the chill without sacrificing comfort. The streets beckon you for a stroll, perhaps through the Boston Common or along the Charles River, where the early twilight casts a serene glow over the waters. Alternatively, a quiet caf\u00e9 awaits those inclined to seek refuge indoors, where the scent of coffee mingles with the promise of a good book or invigorating conversation. Embrace the clarity of the day as a canvas for simple pleasures, making the most of this lovely winter afternoon.",
