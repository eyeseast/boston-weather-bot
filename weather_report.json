    "weather_report": "As the morning unfolds over Boston, a gentle warmth envelops the city, whispered through the soft rustle of leaves and the distant hum of early risers. With temperatures hovering around a balmy 89 degrees, residents can expect a day of mostly sunny skies, punctuated by a heat index that nudges up to a steamy 97. A light southwest breeze offers brief moments of reprieve, making the warmth more bearable but still urging caution for those venturing outdoors.\n\nIn the hours to come, the sun will paint the day with its vibrant strokes, creating an inviting backdrop for leisurely strolls along the Charles or quiet moments in shaded parks. However, as twilight approaches, a hint of haziness will settle over the landscape, with patchy fog creeping in after 5 a.m., lending an air of mystery to the evening. As temperatures descend to a comfortable 71, the chance of evening rain remains minimal, offering just a fleeting chance to appreciate the lushness of the surroundings as the day draws to a close. Dressing in light, breathable fabrics will allow for comfort under the sun by day, while a light layer will suffice as the cooler, fog-laden evening greets you. Activities might include savoring an outdoor coffee in the cool of the evening or a relaxed stroll along the waterfront, embracing the tranquility that a summer night in Boston brings.",
