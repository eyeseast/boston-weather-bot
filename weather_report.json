The air feels cool and slightly damp, carrying with it the promise of rain as it touches softly against the skin. It's a night where the atmosphere is thick with possibilities, where the light dims softly, inviting contemplation. A chance of rain lingers like an uninvited guest, wavering between light showers and gatherings of thunderclouds as the hours pass into the night. The temperatures hover around a refreshing 57 degrees, nudging towards a cozy embrace, especially if you wear something warm\u2014a light jacket or a soft sweater would be wise companions.\n\nAs the dawn breaks on Tuesday, likely doused in a gentle film of moisture, expect a continuation of this narrative\u2014patchy fog will linger until the sun makes its sometimes elusive appearance, casting its warm glow through the clouds. Highs near 71 promise a comforting warmth amidst the ongoing dance of rain showers and the distant rumble of thunder. Amidst this backdrop, take a walk through the quieter streets or along the riverside, where the echoes of raindrops create a soothing symphony against the waking city. Enjoy the subtle beauty of nature\u2019s rhythm, perhaps with a warm beverage in hand, as you watch the world come alive beneath the soft, cloudy canvas.",
