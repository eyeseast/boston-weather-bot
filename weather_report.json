    "weather_report": "In Boston, a blanket of cloud hangs overhead, giving the afternoon an intimate, muted quality. The temperature floats around a pleasant 66 degrees, making it a comfortable companion for a stroll. As the east wind whispers through the trees, there\u2019s a stillness in the air, almost as if the world is holding its breath, waiting for the sun to break through. With the skies mostly adorned in varying shades of gray, the city feels cozy, like an unpretentious gathering of friends waiting to share stories over coffee.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the night promises to remain soft and inviting with temperatures dipping to around 56 degrees. Although the clouds may linger, they bring a gentle repose to the activity of the day. It is an excellent time for a relaxed walk along the riverfront, where the whispers of the water are all the more pronounced in the quiet of the evening. A light jacket would be prudent as you step outside, perhaps accompanied by your favorite scarf, to ward off the coolness that might creep in as the day draws to a close. Whether it\u2019s a visit to a local bookstore or savoring dinner at a quaint eatery, this weather encourages a rhythm of calm, inviting a contemplative pause amidst the hustle of life.",
