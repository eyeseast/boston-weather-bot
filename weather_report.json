    "weather_report": "As dawn ushers in a mostly sunny embrace over Boston, the day awakens with a gentle warmth, nudging the temperature toward a comfortable 77 degrees. The north wind carries a soft whisper, urging one to step outside, to linger a bit longer in the brightening light. Yet, as the sun arcs across the sky, the evening hints at a touch of change, with clouds gathering discreetly and promising a chance of rain after midnight. Tonight, the temperature will settle around a mild 57 degrees, draping a layer of cloud cover over the city, with a hint of moisture in the air\u2014a reminder that nature often dances with unpredictability.\n\nIn terms of attire, this is an invitation to dress comfortably but thoughtfully. A light, breathable fabric during the day can transition seamlessly into a cozy jacket for the evening chill. This weather calls for a stroll through the winding streets of the city or perhaps a quiet moment in one of Boston\u2019s green spaces, where you can savor an ice cream or a warm cup of coffee while watching the scenery change as day slips into night. Opt for a leisurely pace, perhaps a visit to a cozy bookshop or a small caf\u00e9 that catches your eye. The tempo of the day feels serene, promising simple pleasures against the backdrop of an ever-evolving sky.",
