    "weather_report": "In the quiet of this deep February night, Boston rests beneath a shroud of cloudy contemplation, the warmth of the day hidden away, yielding to a chilly low that lingers around the brisk embrace of 16 degrees. The northwest breeze whispers through the streets, a reminder of winter's firm grip, rustling the bare trees along the neighborhood sidewalks. Tomorrow, as the sun rises, those clouds will stretch their shadows over the city, promising a chance of snow that may begin to grace the ground after 3 PM, just as the afternoon grows weary. A touch of gray will wash over the skyline, but the temperature will inch a bit higher, bringing the hope of a high near 31 degrees.\n\nFor those wandering the streets of Boston tomorrow, dressing for the cool air is essential. A sturdy coat, perhaps a knitted scarf to ward off the chill, and a comfortable pair of boots will offer adequate protection against the brisk wind and, potentially, the delicate snowflakes that might begin their descent later in the day. The atmosphere might not inspire grand excursions, but a leisurely afternoon spent in a cozy caf\u00e9, sipping on hot coffee while watching the cityscape outside\u2014a blend of muted tones and soft light\u2014could turn the day into a simple pleasure. A book in hand, or lingering conversations overheard at the next table, will warm the spirits in the face of a cool, cloudy day woven with the delicate promise of snow.",
