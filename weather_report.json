    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks toward the early hours in Boston, the skies remain partly cloudy, enveloping the city in a gentle shroud that gives the night an air of calm introspection. The air is still, with a mild breeze that flirts playfully with the leaves, whispering promises of a warm and pleasant day ahead. Overnight temperatures hover comfortably around sixty-two degrees, inviting night owls to ponder thoughts beneath the subtle glow of city lights.\n\nWhen dawn breaks, Boston will awaken to mostly sunny skies that herald a high of near seventy-seven degrees. Yet as the afternoon unfolds, the warmth will gracefully retreat, offering a more temperate embrace as the mercury dips back toward seventy. The westerly winds, brisk at times, will add a refreshing touch to the day\u2014ideal for a leisurely stroll along the Charles or a quiet coffee on a sun-dappled terrace. Dress lightly, perhaps in layers, for as the day transitions, a light jacket may become a welcome companion. Seek out hidden corners of local parks, or the soft hum of a favorite bookshop, where you can savor life's simple pleasures against the backdrop of a clear, blue expanse.",
