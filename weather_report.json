    "weather_report": "As dawn begins to soften the dark edges of the night in Boston, a blanket of clouds hovers overhead, casting a muted glow over the city. The chill in the air hints at the low temperatures, yet there is a subtle promise of warmth as the mercury is anticipated to rise ever so slightly. The brisk southwest wind carries whispers of the day ahead, suggesting that while the sun will eventually break free from its overcast shroud, the transition will be marked by gusts that command attention.\n\nAs the day unfolds, expect a clear shift to sunshine\u2014a welcome sight after the lingering night. The cold air will become more palpable, making heavy coats and perhaps a light scarf necessary companions for any outing. This Sunday may not invite picnics in the park, but it offers a wonderful opportunity for a leisurely stroll through the charming streets, where the soft light will dance over the historic facades. Perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh coffee and pastries beckons, would be the perfect way to embrace the season. One might even consider a brief stop at an open market, where the vibrant colors of seasonal produce serve as a reminder of nature's resilience against the winter chill. Indeed, the blending of sun, wind, and city spirit creates a day ripe for simple pleasures.",
