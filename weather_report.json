    "weather_report": "As Boston drifts quietly into the night, a gentle shroud of clouds hangs over the city, casting a muted glow upon the landscape. The temperature dips to near 20 degrees, an invitation for layered clothing that promises both warmth and ease of movement. The slight chance of snow flurries lurking after two o\u2019clock is a mere whisper, hardly enough to warrant apprehension, yet offering a hint of magic in the chilly air. \n\nTomorrow promises a subtle shift, with the sun peaking through the clouds to reveal a day near freezing. In the calm, crisp light of morning, a trace of snow may cling to the remnants of overnight flurries, inviting contemplation of winter's quiet beauty. Layering continues to be the mantra, with warm coats and sturdy boots the dress of the day. Embrace the cool, but make plans to wander, perhaps finding joy in an early stroll through one of Boston\u2019s quieter parks or indulging in a cozy visit to a favorite caf\u00e9 where the scent of coffee mingles with the anticipation of a fresh dawn.",
