    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Boston unfolds with an inviting clarity, a pleasant herald of sunshine that bathes the city in warm golden light. As the Northwest breeze carries hints of spring, the air is crisp yet gentle, a perfect companion for a stroll or a leisurely outing. With temperatures hovering around 71 degrees, one might find it a delightful time to grab a light jacket and step into the day; perhaps a visit to one of the local parks, where blooming trees and budding flowers create a tapestry vibrant enough to draw the breath.\n\nAs evening approaches and the sun dips lower, the warmth gives way to a cooler embrace, settling comfortably around a low of 44 degrees. The night will unfold beneath a vast canopy of stars, largely untouched by the hazy shroud of fog\u2014fresh airs beckon those seeking calmness in the quiet aftermath of a bustling day. A light layer will keep the chill at bay as one might settle on a downtown terrace for an intimate dinner, or perhaps meander down winding streets, embracing the serenity of a city calming itself for the night.",
