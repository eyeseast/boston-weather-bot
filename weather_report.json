    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Boston, the air carries a warmth that hints at summer's embrace, punctuated by a gentle southwest breeze rustling through trees. The clouds drift lazily across the sky, creating a tapestry of muted grays that lend a soft glow to the world below. Though the sun tries to break through, its presence feels more like a whisper than a shout, casting a dusky veil over the vibrant city. With temperatures nudging towards 87 degrees, it\u2019s the kind of day that invites you to sip a cool drink while leaning against a sun-warmed railing.\n\nAs evening approaches, expect the mood to shift slightly, easing into a comfortable low of around 66 degrees. Tonight\u2019s partly cloudy skies will wrap the city in a cozy blanket, perfect for an evening stroll along the banks of the Charles River or perhaps settling into a local caf\u00e9 with a good book. Dressing in light fabrics during the day is wise, allowing for that effortless transition into something snugger as the night cools. Given the beauty of this summer day, it may be best to revel in simple pleasures, like discovering a new gelato shop or enjoying the quiet charm of an art gallery, letting the soft, soothing rhythm of the city wash over you as daylight fades.",
