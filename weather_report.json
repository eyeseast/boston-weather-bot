    "weather_report": "In Boston today, a gentle warmth envelops the city as spring reaches its embrace, the sun shining brightly and casting a radiant light on the vibrant greenery that sprawls across the landscape. A brisk northwest breeze stirs the air, bringing a refreshing touch that feels invigorating against the skin. This afternoon promises a delightful high around 67, inviting one to step outside with a lightness in their heart. The sky above is a canvas of azure, unmarred by clouds, ensuring clarity that stretches as far as the horizon allows.\n\nTonight, as twilight descends, expect the temperature to dip to a comfortable 43, with a gentle wind continuing its evening serenade. The crisp air will be best met with a light sweater or a cozy jacket, making it a perfect time for an evening stroll, perhaps along the historic waterfront, where the reflected glow of city lights dances on the gentle waves. Alternatively, settle into a local caf\u00e9, savoring a hot drink while the world outside transitions into a serene evening. The day invites exploration, whether it's a leisurely walk through the parks or a quiet moment collected in the warmth of a favorite corner.",
