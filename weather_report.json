    "weather_report": "As night embraces Boston, a chill underscores the air, wrapping the city in a delicate layer of clouds. The slight possibility of snow flurries lingers between the hours of ten and one, hinting at a symphony of winter's final notes before the curtain falls. The evening's coolness, around 32 degrees, carries a gentle east wind that tousles the shadows of trees while the city's lights flicker like restless dreams against the darkened canvas.\n\nTomorrow holds a promise of a cloudy respite, with the high reaching a modest 45 degrees. It's a day where the sun may shy away, allowing the clouds to dwell a bit longer, perhaps even crafting a backdrop for indoor daydreams. Dressing warmly will be wise; layers will wrap you in comfort, while a sturdy coat and perhaps a soft knit hat will keep the chill at bay. Consider a stroll through the local cafes, where the aroma of fresh coffee mingles with the warmth of camaraderie, or perhaps a visit to an art exhibit, where the imagination can flourish in the cozy obscurity of a gallery. Allow the day to unfold slowly, savoring the simple pleasures as the city holds its breath, waiting for spring's gentle touch.",
