    "weather_report": "As dawn kisses the horizon, Boston finds itself enveloped in a soft shroud of patchy fog, the kind that seems to invite contemplation. The air is still and carries a gentle whisper of warmth, lingering near 68 degrees. A delicate west wind drifts lazily, reminding those awake in the early hours that not all mornings are brisk and bright. The world outside is muted, the edges of the city blurred into a dreamlike haze.\n\nHowever, as morning unfurls, the fog is expected to gradually retreat, making way for the warmth of the sun. Come midday, it will be a day of brilliant blue skies and radiant sunshine, with temperatures rising to a sultry high near 91. A soft north wind will provide a welcome counterpoint to the heat, coaxing city dwellers into the outdoors where one might stroll through the Boston Common or pause at a quaint caf\u00e9 for a leisurely cup of coffee. As for attire, light fabrics are advisable\u2014perhaps a linen shirt paired with comfortable shorts, complemented by the evergreen essence of summer sandals. In this hazy yet promising morning, the promise of a vibrant day awaits.",
