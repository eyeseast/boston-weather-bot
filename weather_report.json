    "weather_report": "As evening descends upon Boston, the city basks in a gentle twilight, the sky displaying muted hues that hint at a coming chill. Tonight, with temperatures dipping into the tranquil realm of fifty degrees, the breeze whispers softly from the northwest, carrying with it a sense of calm and clarity. Although the remnants of the day linger, the air feels fresh and invigorating, devoid of fog, allowing the skyline to emerge distinctly against the backdrop of dusk.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the promise of a sunlit day beckons with clear skies and a pleasant high near seventy. Wrapped in the warm embrace of a mild west wind, it is the perfect backdrop for a morning stroll along the Charles River or a leisurely bicycle ride through the vibrant alleys of the city. As you prepare for the day, light layers will suffice\u2014the morning should greet you with a crisp feel, transitioning smoothly into a comforting warmth by midday. Consider a light jacket for the early hours, perhaps with a favorite scarf to catch the soft breezes. In the spirit of adventure, a visit to one of Boston's quaint caf\u00e9s for a warm cup of coffee may be the perfect way to savor the calm before the sun illuminates the day ahead.",
