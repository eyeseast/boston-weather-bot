    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, a veil of muted colors drapes the city, whispering of fleeting showers that came and went in the early hours. The day fights a gentle chill, reaching for a high just above freezing, while brisk westward winds slice through the air, offering an invigorating chill to those who step outside. The clouds, though largely friendly, hold a promise of snow later in the evening, so the wise wanderer might pack a scarf or a hat to ward off the growing winter bite as the afternoon progresses.\n\nFor the rest of the day, mostly sunny skies will emerge, revealing the beauty of stark winter landscapes, yet expect a serene descent toward nighttime as the mercury hovers dangerously close to 20 degrees. If you find yourself wandering the streets of Boston, consider slipping into a cozy caf\u00e9 for a warm drink, or perhaps taking an afternoon stroll through the historic streets wrapped in a warm coat. The promise of evening snow invites a sense of tranquility, making it a perfect time to settle in with a book or gather with friends in the comfort of home as the first flakes begin to dance outside your window, transforming the world into a quiet, white wonderland.",
