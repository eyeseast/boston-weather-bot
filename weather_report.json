    "weather_report": "As the hushed hours of the night linger over Boston, a cloak of clouds has settled in, wrapping the city in a cool embrace. The temperature is poised to dip, drifting down to about 20 degrees, accompanied by a brisk west wind that whispers promises of the morning chill. The streets, muted by the soft glow of streetlights, offer a stillness that invites contemplation. At this hour, an expedition outdoors might call for layers\u2014perhaps a woolen hat and a warm scarf to guard against the bite of the wind, while a sturdy jacket provides solace from the dusk.\n\nAwakening to a new day, the sun will ascend over the horizon, chasing away the clouds to reveal a brilliant blue sky. It is a forecast of clear, sunny weather, where Boston stretches wide under shafts of golden light and the northwest wind orchestrates a lively dance of leaves and layers. The day will reach a high around 29 degrees, rejuvenating the earlier gloom into an invigorating canvas, perfect for a brisk stroll along the Charles or a leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9. Donning a lighter jacket and comfy shoes will serve well, ensuring one feels both at ease and ready to embrace the vibrant rhythm of the day. Such a morning calls for quiet discoveries\u2014perhaps exploring an undiscovered bookshop or savoring a moment at a favorite park bench, breathing in the crisp air that heralds new possibilities.",
