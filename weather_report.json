    "weather_report": "As evening cloaks Boston in a blanket of clouds, the air hangs heavy with the promise of snow. Tonight's forecast paints a picture of chilly solitude, where snow showers will gently fall before 11 PM, ushering in a tranquil yet biting cold. The mercury is expected to tumble to around 7 degrees, and with the wind chill dipping to a stark -3, it's a time for layers. A northwest wind, brisk and relentless, will remind anyone braving the outdoors of the winter\u2019s firm grip. The chance of new snow accumulation concerns about 1 to 3 inches, softening the landscape into a winter wonderland, yet one that might go unseen until morning light.\n\nTomorrow dawns with the sun trying to break through, promising a more cheerful scene despite the retained cold. The high temperature will struggle to reach 21 degrees, and wind chill values may keep any warmth at bay, lingering around -6. A west wind will weave through the city, ideal for those with plans to venture out, albeit warmly bundled. On a day like this, there's magic in the muted stillness brought by the snow. A walk through the Boston Public Garden may reveal the beauty of frost-kissed branches or the serenity of a quiet park bench. But remember, today and tomorrow call for thick coats, cozy scarves, and sturdy boots. The beauty of the evening snow and the subsequent clarity of a sunny day just waiting to emerge might compel you to explore the quiet corners of this historic city, lending a touch of warmth to a cold winter's night.",
