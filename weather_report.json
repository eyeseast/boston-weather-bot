    "weather_report": "The night in Boston carries a somber weight, cloaked in clouds as rain taps softly against the windows. The air is charged, hinting at the subtle drama of a possible thunderstorm, and the winds, brisk and insistent, weave their way through the empty streets, cooling the dampness just a touch. Dressed in layers, one might find solace in a sturdy jacket, perhaps accompanied by a sturdy umbrella, as the forecast promises a deluge of rain that could accumulate in tight puddles along the sidewalks. \n\nTomorrow dawns with its own brand of melancholy, as the rain lingers into the morning, easing into a gentle drizzle throughout the day. The skies will remain overcast, casting a muted light that offers beauty in its restraint. There is comfort to be found indoors\u2014visiting a cozy cafe with a warm beverage in hand or poking around a local bookstore, letting the hours slip by as the world outside remains enshrouded. The day calls for practicality over pomp, urging a reliable pair of shoes suitable for slippery streets and an inner warmth that reflects the soul of this city, ever so vibrant, even when muted.",
