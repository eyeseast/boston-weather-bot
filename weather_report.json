    "weather_report": "As the night deepens in Boston, the air hangs heavy with a blanket of clouds, bringing a chill that wraps around you like a well-worn shawl. The temperature hovers around the cool end of the spectrum, suggesting that if you venture out, a warm layer will be your faithful companion, allowing for comfort amid the brisk whispers of the southwest wind. The landscape is adorned with distant city lights, twinkling like stars fallen to earth, creating a serene backdrop for reflective midnight strolls.\n\nAs dawn approaches and the hours of Wednesday unfold, the skies are expected to remain mostly cloudy, with a glimmer of possibility for light rain around noon, a gentle reminder of the day's variable nature. The high, though milder, will carry a promise of warmth, inviting pedestrians to don their lightest jackets, perhaps a scarf for good measure. A stroll through a nearby park or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 could serve as the perfect antidote to this melancholic yet enchanting winter day, where both contemplation and conversation find their harmony under the muted light of the season.",
