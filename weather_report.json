With temperatures dipping down to around 38, a gentle northwest wind whispers through the city, cool yet calming. The clarity of the night sky allows the luminescence of urban life to shine unimpeded, revealing the warm glow of distant lights and reminding us that beneath the starry expanse, the city breathes steadily, wrapped in its nighttime stillness.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the promise of a sunlit Sunday beckons. Tomorrow, expect a radiant sun casting its golden hue over the bustling streets, temperatures reaching toward a delightful 59. However, by afternoon, the warmth may retreat slightly, offering a cooler embrace, an invitation for layers. Dress in light but warm garments\u2014a cozy sweater under a jacket will suffice, along with comfortable shoes for those who might wish to stroll through the city\u2019s parks or along the harbor, soaking in the day\u2019s vibrant energy. With the weather so agreeable, one might consider visiting a local caf\u00e9, indulging in a warm drink while observing life unfold, enjoying the simple beauty of a day that celebrates the transition from the cool embrace of autumn into the heart of winter.",
