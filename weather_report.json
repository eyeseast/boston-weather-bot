    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the night, Boston cloaks itself in a gentle embrace of drizzle and fog. The air is cool, a whispering reminder of the lingering chill of early spring, as the temperatures sink just below the threshold of comfort. A hazy softness envelops the city, allowing only muted silhouettes to emerge, while the southeast breeze carries a hint of moisture, underscoring the quiet ambiance of this nocturnal landscape.\n\nAs dawn approaches, the cloud cover will persist, creating a grayish canvas that hints at a day shrouded in mist. The fog will be reluctant to lift until later in the morning, but by noon, a modest warming will usher in temperatures reaching the mid-fifties. It will be a day best met in layers: a light sweater or a windbreaker could serve as a protective barrier against the dampness, paired with sensible footwear for those who may be tempted to stroll through the city\u2019s hushed streets. A hot cup of coffee in hand, one might find solace in a visit to a nearby caf\u00e9, where the warmth and the hum of conversation provide a stark contrast to the cool air outside. Alternatively, browsing through a local bookstore or art gallery could present a lovely way to spend the hours, wrapped in the quiet charm that a foggy day brings.",
