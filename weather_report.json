The temperature is cooling, settling around a crisp 49 degrees, and the air carries a gentle bite, stirred by a northwestern breeze\u2014an echo of winter's retreat yet still palpable in the evening's chill. For those out and about, a light jacket or sweater becomes a trusted companion to fend off the evening breeze, blending comfort with subtle sophistication.\n\nTomorrow promises a serene transition, as the sun will awaken to clear skies and a gentle warmth, nudging temperatures near 73 degrees with a soft wind teasing the branches above. It will be a day ideal for leisurely strolls through Boston\u2019s historic streets or perhaps a quiet afternoon in one of its lush parks. Consider indulging in a book while seated at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, or take a casual jaunt along the Charles, where the glimmer of blue and the laughter of passersby might lift your spirits. The juxtaposition of tonight's muted tones and tomorrow\u2019s vibrant promise creates an invitation to embrace both the calm of dusk and the beauty of a new day gently unfolding.",
