    "weather_report": "As darkness envelops Boston this evening, the air carries the crisp chill typical of late November. Isolated snow showers flirted with the evening sky earlier, leaving a gentle reminder of winter's approach, though the clouds are now parting to reveal a serene, partly cloudy expanse. The temperature hovers around 28 degrees, complemented by a gusty west wind that whispers its presence at about eight miles per hour. While the air feels invigorating, with a slight chance of precipitation now receding, a shroud of quiet calm has settled over the city, lending itself to a respite that few may appreciate.\n\nAs we look ahead to Saturday, a charming sun will grace the horizon, promising a bright day with a high nearing 40 degrees\u2014ideal for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River or perhaps indulging in a cup of coffee at a quaint caf\u00e9 in the South End. Layers will be your best ally: a warm coat, a cozy scarf, and perhaps a woolen hat to fend off the cool breeze. With the potential for sunshine, those with a touch of spontaneity might find joy in visiting the local markets or taking a quiet moment in one of the city's parks, savoring the last hints of autumn before winter settles in for good.",
