    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Boston, a tapestry of gray clouds blankets the sky, evoking a sense of calm interspersed with the promise of rain. The air, crisp yet soft with the breath of an approaching storm, carries hints of moisture as the southeast winds murmur through the trees. Light showers may grace the city intermittently, setting the scene for a cozy evening ahead. \n\nTonight, the atmosphere will thicken with the likelihood of steady rain and patchy fog, transforming the urban landscape into a watercolor painting of muted hues as twilight deepens. With temperatures dropping to a brisk 39 degrees, a warm coat becomes essential, alongside a sturdy umbrella to fend off the persistent drizzle. As the weather entices most to retreat indoors, consider finding a nook in a local caf\u00e9, where the scent of fresh coffee mingles with the sounds of quiet conversation, creating a perfect refuge from the elements. This evening, as shadows lengthen and fog rolls in, the warmth of community and a good book will serve as splendid companions against the cool dampness outside.",
