    "weather_report": "As the early morning unfolds over Boston, a gentle serenity blankets the city, with temperatures dipping to a brisk 44 degrees. The clear skies invite a cool breeze from the west, rustling through the quiet streets. As dawn breaks, it prepares the way for a Sunday filled with partly sunny hues, where the cool air will give way to a pleasant 56 degrees later in the day. The westward winds, whispering at 13 to 18 mph, carry a certain freshness that speaks of possibility, although they may gust forth with playful vigor now and again.\n\nSuch weather calls for a careful choice in attire\u2014a light jacket layered over a comfortable sweater should suffice, allowing one to embrace both the crispness of the morning and the gradual warmth of the afternoon. As the climate encourages exploration, the hours ahead invite a stroll through the nearby parks, where the freshness of the grass and the awakening of blossoms beckon. A quiet moment at a caf\u00e9, sipping something warm while looking out onto the unfolding city life, would perfectly suit this lovely day. For those seeking a modest adventure, a leisurely walk along the Charles River could provide rejuvenation, a treasured escape amid the gentle stirrings of a Boston spring day.",
