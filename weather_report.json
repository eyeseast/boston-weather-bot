    "weather_report": "Tonight, Boston stands under a shroud of cloudiness, the air crisp and biting with a gentle west wind whispering through the city. A chill lingers, hinting at the low temperature that will settle around the low twenties, inviting you to draw your coat a little closer, perhaps wrapping your hands in the warmth of pockets as you step outside. The nighttime sky, though not perfectly clear, might reveal the occasional twinkle from distant stars peeking through the veil, patiently waiting for morning.\n\nAs Sunday dawns, Boston promises to unveil a partially sunny disposition, an antidote to last night's gloom. The sun will rise, draping the city in a warmer glow, coaxing its inhabitants outdoors to soak in the brightness. Despite the brisk winds that will dance around, with gusts playfully nudging at clothing, a high near thirty-one degrees will transform the day into a pleasant winter outing. This is a time to stroll along the Charles River, reveling in the revitalizing energy of the early hours, or perhaps to lose oneself in the quietude of a cozy caf\u00e9 with a steaming cup of coffee. As you venture forth, ensure you\u2019re bundled up warmly\u2014gloves and scarves recommended\u2014for it is still winter, and the wind may sway unexpectedly, reminding you of the season's tenacity.",
