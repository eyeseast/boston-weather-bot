    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Boston, a blanket of clouds drapes the city, heralding a typical New England day where the sun casts a wistful absence. With temperatures hovering just above the chill of winter, the air carries a brisk whisper from the east, inviting a touch of warmth in the attire\u2014perhaps a well-worn sweater beneath a sturdy jacket to fend off that persistent bite. \n\nAs night descends, the sky will awaken with the prospect of rain, transitioning tentatively to snow, and later to sleet, an orchestra of precipitation dancing through the dark. The streets might glisten with a thin sheen of moisture, punctuated by the thickening fog that will soon blanket the landscape. In preparation for these shifting elements, soft, durable footwear may prove prudent for those venturing out. While the evening invites a cozy gathering indoors\u2014perhaps cradling a warm mug of tea and contemplating the comforts of home\u2014there remains an appeal in a brisk stroll through the streets, where the soft glow of streetlights serves as a comforting guide amidst the evening\u2019s dusky embrace.",
