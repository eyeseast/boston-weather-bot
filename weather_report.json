    "weather_report": "As the night cloaks Boston in its gentle embrace, a veil of fog whispers secrets through the cool air, teasing the edges of the city's skyline. With temperatures settling around a mild 64 degrees, the northeast wind carries the faintest hint of fresh possibilities. A soft cloud cover blankets the skies, suggesting a tranquil night, perfect for contemplation or quietude. \n\nAs dawn approaches, the early hours will usher in lingering fog before yielding to a day that promises mostly cloudy skies, accompanied by a warm embrace of 81 degrees. The world will gradually awaken under a muted light, ideal for leisurely strolls along the Esplanade or embracing the cozy corners of a local caf\u00e9. Dressing in breathable layers will strike the right balance between comfort and warmth, allowing for spontaneous ventures into the city. Today calls for simplicity; perhaps a visit to a nearby bookstore or an afternoon spent enjoying the company of a friend over steaming cups, laced with laughter and light conversation.",
