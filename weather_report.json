    "weather_report": "As the cool embrace of autumn settles over Boston, the night unfolds quietly, the air cradling a refreshing chill that beckons to those with a taste for evening walks. Currently, the city rests beneath a mostly clear sky, with temperatures dipping to a gentle low of around 44, stirred by a whispering north breeze, perfect for an unhurried stroll through the park or a moment of solitude on the balcony. With dawn not far off, tomorrow promises a sun-drenched canvas, inviting warmth near 61 as light winds from the northeast tease into the day, setting a tone of vibrant clarity.\n\nFor the thoughtful wanderer, layering will be a wise choice, as the morning chill may linger even as the sun ascends, casting long shadows and lifting spirits. A light jacket will serve well until the sun's rays warm the soul, and comfortable shoes will carry you through the day\u2019s leisurely pursuits\u2014perhaps a visit to a corner caf\u00e9 to sip on freshly brewed coffee or a leisurely saunter through the cobbled streets lined with the colors of early autumn. With the day awakening gently from its slumber, the combination of freshness and brightness invites contemplation, exploration, and simple pleasures.",
