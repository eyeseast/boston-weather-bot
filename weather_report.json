    "weather_report": "Boston finds itself basking in the warmth of a gentle afternoon sun, the air crisp yet inviting with hints of spring's embrace. As the day unfolds toward its golden moments, clouds linger, softening the sky, suggesting a tranquil evening ahead. With a subtle east wind nudging past at 12 mph, it feels like the city\u2019s heartbeat is aligned with nature\u2019s steady rhythm. The high, brushing close to 70 degrees, encourages a light touch in attire \u2014 perhaps a comfortable shirt paired with a cardigan for the coolness that settles in as twilight approaches.\n\nAs you transition into evening, the low dips to around 50, and the clouds gather more pronouncedly, cloaking the horizon in an evocative mystery. It\u2019s the kind of night to explore an intimate caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with laughter, or perhaps meander through nearby parks, taking in the fading light and the sound of leaves whispering against the fresh air. With the tranquility of the day still resonating, consider a leisurely stroll to appreciate the vibrant energy of the city as it prepares to wind down, making the most of this pleasant afternoon before settling into a cozy evening.",
