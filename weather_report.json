    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Boston, there\u2019s a quiet stillness punctuated by the gentle embrace of patchy fog, dancing briefly before the waning hours till 11 PM. The thermometer dips to a crisp 20 degrees, and a brisk west wind whistles through the streets, sending shivers that prick the skin and remind us of winter's lingering grasp. The scattered clouds drift lazily across the sky, hinting at the chill yet to come but leaving a sense of calm beneath their murky veil. With gusts rattling as high as 47 mph, those stepping outside should seek warmth in layers\u2014a sturdy coat, perhaps with a scarf and hat to protect against the wintery gusts that swirl unpredictably, much like the fog that cloaks the surroundings.\n\nAs dawn breaks on Washington's Birthday, one can expect a refreshing change; the sun will rise bright and mostly clear, painting the horizon in shades of crisp blue and white. Temperatures will nudge up towards a lively 27, encouraging the city\u2019s denizens to embrace the sunlight and the sheer brightness of the day. With the wind continuing to rustle at speeds of 20 to 25 mph, walking through the parks or venturing out to savor a hot cup of coffee while perched by the window becomes a delightful way to spend the morning. Perhaps a visit to a local bookstore, where the warmth of fresh pages meets the chill outside, will offer both solace and inspiration. Layering continues to be your friend, as the juxtaposition of warmth indoors and the bracing air outside remains ever present.",
