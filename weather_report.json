    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens into night across Boston, a stirring chill settles into the air, with temperatures dipping to a brisk five degrees. The night is an elegant tapestry, partly cloudy yet serene, creating a backdrop for the city lights to twinkle like scattered stars upon the ground. Wind chill adds a formidable bite, reminding all who venture outside to wrap themselves in layers, favoring warmth over style. The gentle northwest breeze, whispering with a playful 5 mph, reminds us to draw our scarves tightly and perhaps don a hat that protects our ears from the cold.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, one can anticipate a refreshing turn as the sun makes its grand entrance, lifting temperatures to a near-warm 19 degrees. However, the cruel hand of winter still holds sway, as morning temperatures come with wind chill lows reaching down to a bite-sized -6. For those stepping out into this sunny yet crisp day, it is wise to wear insulated outerwear and sturdy footwear, ready for both the chill and the potential for glistening frost in shaded corners. While the bright clarity of the sun may beckon us to explore, consider a leisurely stroll through the nearby parks, perhaps warming up our hands with a cozy coffee in the process, or indulging in a tranquil moment by the waterfront where the sun can share its embrace.",
