    "weather_report": "In this early hour, the skies over Boston bear the weight of impending change, draped in a blanket of thickening clouds that hint at the softness of rain soon to come. The day begins with a tentative warmth, the remnants of a pleasant spring teased by the sun but tempered by an encroaching chill as temperatures gracefully slide toward cooler numbers. The southeast wind, gentle yet persistent, invites both wanderers and those who prefer the comfort of home to fully embrace the day's offerings.\n\nAs the hours inch forward, anticipate a gradual cloudiness that will envelop the skyline, perhaps obscuring that familiar glint of sunshine. With the evening's approach, the chance of rain looms larger, a 40% probability that may whisper of light showers. Attire should be both light and layered\u2014consider a breathable jacket to fend off the coolness that accompanies the hopeful promise of spring rain. Perfect for a stroll around the neighborhood or a quiet visit to the local caf\u00e9, today calls for simple joys\u2014a good book under an awning or the calming company of a friend as the clouds gather. Engage with the city's charm, sensing the life around you before the rain touches the ground.",
