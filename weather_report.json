    "weather_report": "As the sun dips below the horizon, Boston nestles into a cloak of patchy fog that sweeps across the landscape, painting the city in a gentle gray hue. The temperature cools to a comforting 39 degrees, inviting a soft sweater and perhaps a light scarf to ward off the brisk northern breeze. The quiet moments of the night inspire a cup of warm tea or the simple pleasure of a book by the window, watching as shadows dance against the glimmer of city lights.\n\nWith dawn on the horizon, Monday promises to dawn bright and optimistic, as the fog gradually dissipates to unveil a refreshing sunlit sky. The forecast hints at a delightful high near 66, each ray of sunlight infused with a gentle warmth, encouraging light layers to usher in the day. A leisurely stroll along the Charles River beckons, where the vibrant trees sway in the soft breeze, and the radiant blooms greet early passersby with open arms. It's a fine day to explore local art galleries or to savor a meal outdoors at one of Boston's charming cafes, welcoming the spring and all its possibilities. Enjoy each moment, for there's beauty to be found in the mundane.",
