    "weather_report": "As the evening envelops Boston, the air carries a distinct chill, a reminder that winter has taken firm hold. The clouds above hang heavy and mostly obscured, offering only scant glimpses of the stars, while gusts of wind cut sharply through the night. The low temperature lurks around 16 degrees, which feels crisper against the skin with the additional bite of westward winds. Those venturing out would do well to bundle up, choosing layers that serve both warmth and movement\u2014the mix of a sturdy winter coat, a hat snug against the ears, and gloves to protect exposed hands will be essential for comfort.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, Boston prepares for a morning that may greet the city with a light dance of snow showers before noon. Though the clouds promise flurries, the day should calm into a mostly cloudy backdrop, with highs struggling to reach 29 degrees. The wind chill may drop the feel even further, perhaps flirting with zero. As you plan your day, a practical mindset will reward you; consider a cozy caf\u00e9 or a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the sea\u2019s breath mingles with the crisp air. Ensure your attire is sensible\u2014ample insulation is key, and boots with a solid grip will be beneficial as you navigate potential patches of snow or ice. This winter's day holds a quiet charm, beckoning you to embrace the stillness and beauty of the season.",
