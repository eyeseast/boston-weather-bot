    "weather_report": "As twilight drapes Boston in shades of gray, the sky holds a quiet promise of the warmth that graced the day. The clouds, tinged with muted colors of softer blues and purples, tell a story of a humid night ahead. With a gentle wind rustling through the trees, the streets remain vibrant yet subdued, inviting evening strolls beneath the whisper of a 30% chance of rain. This air, remarkably warm for the season, carries hints of potential summer thunderstorms, urging a light jacket or perhaps a cozy sweater for those venturing out after dusk.\n\nThe day to come holds the allure of golden sunbeams, a brief upward turn toward 83 degrees that many will embrace with open arms. Such warmth, coupled with gusty winds, calls for comfortable attire\u2014a simple t-shirt paired with breathable shorts, or perhaps a sundress that captures the essence of the sun-drenched afternoon. Those who find themselves free might take the opportunity to explore city parks or enjoy a leisurely lunch outdoors, relishing in the rhythm of the bustling streets. It is a day where creativity can thrive, inviting a visit to an art gallery or a simple coffee shop where conversations drift as easily as the forsythia swaying in the breeze.",
