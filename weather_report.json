A high near fifty-one beckons outdoor enthusiasts to enjoy understated pursuits: a leisurely stroll through the tranquil paths of Boston Common, where budding flowers begin to tease their colors, or perhaps a quiet sit at a favorite caf\u00e9, warming hands around a steaming mug. Today sits poised as a delightful reminder of the transition towards spring\u2014a day to embrace the outdoors, if only for an hour or two, allowing the sun to lift spirits as it casts its gentle glow over the city.",
