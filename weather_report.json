    "weather_report": "The morning in Boston greets you with a heavy embrace of mist, where fog lingers like an old memory, shrouding the city in a veil of ethereal gray. Showers and the possibility of thunderstorms hang in the air, evoking a sense of quiet anticipation. With a slight stir of a southerly breeze punctuated by gusts that dance through the streets, today\u2019s warmth hovers near 68 degrees, wrapping you in a cloak that is part briskness, part warmth. The atmosphere, while slightly unsettled with the chance of sporadic rain, invites you to walk contemplatively. \n\nAs the day unfolds, expect the clouds to weave their story with transient patches of clarity emerging through the overcast sky. For those seeking solace from the impending drizzle, an afternoon spent with a warm cup of coffee in a favorite caf\u00e9 or meandering through a local bookstore might be just what the moment demands. A light jacket or an umbrella wouldn\u2019t be out of place, offering both protection from the elements and comfort against the chill of the evening, which promises to drop to a cooler 51 degrees. Consider this a day to find joy in the simplicity of life, as the fog envelops the city and offers a gentle reminder of the beauty in stillness.",
