    "weather_report": "As dawn unfolds in Boston, the city is enveloped in a shroud of light drizzle and mist, the air heavy with humidity and an elusive fog that dances around the streets. The day begins under a muted palette, as gray clouds hang like a gentle curtain across the skyline, softly obscuring contours and fine details. While the temperature rises to a mild 55 degrees, the drizzly nature of the morning creates a chill that suggests a warm wrap or a cozy sweater might be wise companions for your morning jaunts. A light breeze from the southeast adds an element of stillness, inviting a contemplative stroll through local streets where the soft patter of rain accompanies the sound of distant life.\n\nAs evening approaches, there's a likelihood that the rain will intensify, bringing with it more fog that blankets the surroundings. With a low dipping to around 42 degrees, stepping out later may call for a more insulated choice of attire, perhaps a raincoat or a layer beneath that can shield against the pooling moisture. Given these conditions, this is not a day for grand outings; instead, it offers a perfect opportunity to curl up with a book in a caf\u00e9, sipping something warm while watching the quiet life of the city\u2014where droplets intermingle with laughter, and the world feels both calm and invitingly introspective.",
