    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the sun hangs high and unencumbered, casting a warm glow over the city. The afternoon promises a serene embrace, where the gentle east wind whispers through the green leaves and the vibrant streets breathe life into the day. Expect clear skies, painted in soft azure hues, as temperatures rise toward a summery warmth that invites leisurely outings or a quiet moment with a good book in a shady park nook. The evening will transition with a soft clarity, allowing for a pleasant nighttime stroll under a tender sky, the warm air settling around you like a light embrace.\n\nAs you prepare for this radiant day, consider light, breathable fabrics; perhaps a cotton shirt paired with comfortable shorts or a loose dress, accompanied by a trusty pair of sunglasses. As the sun begins to dip lower, the warmth lingers, so a light layer could serve well to fend off any evening chill. With such splendid weather, a leisurely walk along the Charles River or a sit at a local caf\u00e9 would make for an enjoyable way to savor the beauty that unfolds around you, ensuring that the day is one steeped in simple pleasures.",
