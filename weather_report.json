    "weather_report": "As evening settles over Boston, a blanket of clarity enshrouds the city, punctuated only by the shimmering lights of distant towers and the soft glow of awakening neighborhoods. The breeze carries a crispness that suggests the night will be brisk, urging inhabitants to don layers before stepping into the cool air. Tonight\u2019s temperatures will dip to a frosty low, and the west winds are spirited, occasionally gusting to a lively 46 miles per hour, stirring up the silvery remnants of clouds that linger just above.\n\nLooking ahead to Wednesday, the promise of sunshine hovers on the horizon, bringing warmth to what begins as a clear and bright morning. As the day unfolds, residents can expect a refreshing high that beckons them outdoors. Given the current chill, bundling up in a warm coat, perhaps complemented by a snug scarf and comfortable boots, will ensure one stays comfortably attired for the brisk day ahead. With the weather favoring clarity, a stroll along the Charles River or a leisurely visit to one of Boston's many parks could serve as an ideal way to appreciate the day. As light spills over the city, basking in the golden glow of afternoon sun may awaken an urge for simple pleasures\u2014like sipping a warm beverage at a favorite caf\u00e9 or unwinding with a good book outdoors, cherishing the transition into spring.",
