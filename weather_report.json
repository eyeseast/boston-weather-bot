    "weather_report": "As midnight casts its quiet spell over Boston, the city envelops itself in gentle stillness, illuminated only by scattered city lights that twinkle like distant stars. The air remains comfortably cool, a whisper of warmth still lingering, hinting at the pleasant day to come. Within the next few hours, a serene dawn will unfold, greeting residents with mostly clear skies and a low temperature that wraps the morning in a crisp hug.\n\nAs Tuesday approaches, the sun will break free, flooding the landscape with bright light and warmth. With a high hovering around 77 degrees, the day promises to be inviting and vibrant, enhanced by a soft southwest breeze that may occasionally gust, reminding us of the vitality of spring. It\u2019s the perfect day to step out in light layers; perhaps a relaxed cotton shirt or a breezy dress, complemented by comfortable shoes to explore the city. Now is the time for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, or perhaps a tranquil moment at one of the local parks, where the lush greenery is eager to flourish under the sun. Given the clarity of the day, consider pausing for a quiet coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9, letting the sights and sounds of Boston fill your senses with a comforting sense of belonging.",
