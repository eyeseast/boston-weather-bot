    "weather_report": "As the early morning hours linger over Boston, a shroud of clouds clings to the night, wrapping the city in a gentle embrace of gray. The air carries a coolness that whispers of the day ahead\u2014somewhere between brisk and biting, with a little more bite in the air as the northwest winds give a playful tussle to anything left unanchored. By the appointed hour of sunrise, the skies will remain enigmatic, a canvas painted with muted tones that dance above the skyline, hinting at the potential for a slight drizzle as the clock strikes five. The world below appears to be shuffling into life, buoyed by the warmth of home while the branches sway with the morning breeze.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the clouds will hang steadfastly, diminishing any hopes for sunlight while the temperatures flirt around the mid-fifties. It isn\u2019t a day for bright, bold colors or carefree light attire; instead, one might lean into the comforts of solid layers\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater or a light jacket, accompanied by a well-loved pair of sturdy shoes. There will be pockets of drizzle, yet, this ambience offers a chance to embrace the serene joy of a quiet drizzle, perfect for a gentle stroll along the riverbanks or popping into a cozy caf\u00e9 where warm drinks provide those moments of simple delight. Perhaps a visit to a new bookstore is in order, where one can lose time among the shelves\u2014a delightful counter to the cool dampness outside.",
