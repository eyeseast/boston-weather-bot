    "weather_report": "As the sun rises over Boston, the day unfolds beneath a canvas that hints at its variable nature. The morning air carries a crispness that speaks of spring, though clouds drift lazily across the sky, creating a playful interplay of light and shadow. With a high expected near 72, the warmth will gently seep in, only to dip later as the afternoon wears on. A slight chance of rain showers may flirt with our plans after four, introducing a chance of surprise amidst the otherwise calm atmosphere. The soft northwest wind rustles leaves but remains shy, whispering at two to seven miles per hour\u2014enough to make one appreciate the delicate embrace of the breeze.\n\nAs daylight wanes, the evening will veil the city in a shroud of clouds and an increased likelihood of rain. A hint of humidity may envelope the surroundings, hinting at potential showers, with a low that draws down to a cooler 47 degrees. The prospect of evening thunderstorms adds a hint of drama, a reminder of nature\u2019s unpredictability. Given this weather, layering is the practical choice\u2014perhaps a light jacket to guard against the evening chill, paired with comfortable clothing that allows for ease of movement. As the day transitions, consider a quiet stroll through the streets or a restful evening at a local caf\u00e9, where you can relish a book, a warm drink, and the growing ambiance of city life.",
