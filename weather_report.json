    "weather_report": "A gentle warmth envelops Boston this morning, hinting at a day of serene beauty. With the sun casting its golden gaze, the atmosphere is mostly sunny, inviting locals to step outside and embrace the freshness of late spring. As temperatures climb closer to a comfortable 78 degrees, the light west wind whispers through the trees, creating a harmonious backdrop for a variety of outdoor activities. The clarity of the sky, unmarred by fog, suggests an ideal moment for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River, or perhaps a quiet read in one of Boston\u2019s many parks.\n\nAs evening approaches, the sky will gradually cloak itself in a soft layer of clouds, ushering in cooler temperatures that settle around a refreshing 56 degrees. This shift may call for a light sweater or a cozy jacket as the day wraps up, especially for those lingering outdoors. Whether it\u2019s an evening walk through the historic streets or a gathering with friends at a nearby caf\u00e9, the day holds a balance of tranquility and mildness that complements the gentle rhythms of life in the city.",
