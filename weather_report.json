    "weather_report": "Beneath a vast expanse of cerulean sky, the city of Boston awakens to a Christmas Day marked by clarity and calm. The sun shines brightly, casting a crisp light across the streets where a gentle northwest wind whispers through the trees. As the day unfolds, temperatures hover delicately around freezing, inviting those who venture outside to bundle up in layers. Light jackets, perhaps paired with warm scarves and a woolen hat, are likely to provide the comfort needed against the chill. \n\nThis afternoon is a perfect time to stroll through the park, the blanket of snow crunching softly underfoot, or to savor a hot drink at a nearby caf\u00e9, steam curling invitingly into the cold air. The lack of fog allows for splendid views of the city skyline, a reminder of the beauty inherent in even the longest winter days. As darkness approaches, the clouds will gradually increase, blanketing the sky and ushering in a drop in temperature. Tonight\u2019s lows will call for a little extra warmth, making cozy evenings at home with a good book or a classic movie even more appealing.",
