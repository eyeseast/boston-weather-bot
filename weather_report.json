    "weather_report": "In the depths of the night, Boston wraps itself in a cloak of clouds and coolness, with only a hint of rain that may come and go before dawn. The air is crisp, carrying whispers of the approaching day while a light southwest breeze rustles the stillness. As your morning unfolds, the clouds linger but give way to the promise of sun, transforming into a partly sunny expanse by midday. The high will treat you to a comfortable warmth, a reminder of spring's embrace hovering around fifty-eight degrees.\n\nAs you step out into this emerging day, consider dressing in layers; a lightweight jacket will provide just enough comfort against the memory of night\u2019s chill. A brisk stroll along your favorite streets could be invigorating, perhaps a quiet visit to a local caf\u00e9 where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the sounds of early risers. Delve into the simple art of people-watching, or perhaps bring a book along to savor while the world begins to buzz around you. The day holds a beauty in its steadily revealing clarity, a backdrop inviting you to absorb each moment with quiet appreciation.",
