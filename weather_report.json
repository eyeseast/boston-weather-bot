    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Boston, a gentle stillness blankets the city, punctuated by the sparkling glow of distant lights. The temperature rests comfortably around 70, with a light northwest wind whispering through the trees, providing a quiet reassurance of a changing day ahead. The forecast promises a sunny Friday, where the warmth will rise, pulling the mercury close to 83. The freedom of the open sky invites thoughts of leisurely strolls or perhaps a visit to a local caf\u00e9, where one might relish a morning brew while basking in the gentle rise of the sun.\n\nIn the brightening hours to come, consider shedding heavier layers; a simple shirt and light trousers will do well as the day unfolds into its sunny embrace. The mild gusts may offer a refreshing touch, but nothing too tempestuous to disturb one\u2019s day. It\u2019s an ideal occasion to wander through Boston\u2019s parks, perhaps a quiet moment near the Charles River to soak in the vibrant warmth and watch the world awaken. So, whether it\u2019s a casual jaunt or a more exhilarating adventure, today\u2019s conditions beckon the curious to step outside and enjoy all that this lovely summer day has to offer.",
