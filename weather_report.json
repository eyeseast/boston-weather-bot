    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the heavens seem to dance on the cusp of uncertainty. As the clock strikes ten, wisps of rain may emerge, lingering here and there, but overall the atmosphere holds a promise of mostly cloudy skies. The air carries a brisk kiss from the northwest, a wind that playfully tugs at loose strands and coaxes jackets into becoming companions. Temperatures hover around a gentle 60 degrees, inviting a blend of layers for comfort\u2014perhaps a soft sweater or a light jacket over a favorite shirt. \n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds may deepen, cradling the city in an embrace of mildness with lows settling around 46. Bundling up would seem wise, lest the wind become too familiar as twilight asserts its presence, inviting you to draw closer to the warmth of home. Amidst this cool yet soft backdrop, a leisurely stroll through the commons or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 might serve as the perfect antidote to the day\u2019s uncertainties. Watch the world move softly around you, letting the subtle shifts of spring fill your spirit.",
