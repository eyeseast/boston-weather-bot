    "weather_report": "As the evening drapes itself over Boston, the air carries a crispness that hints at what lies ahead. Tonight, the city is cloaked in a veil of clouds, with the prospect of a light snow arriving in the early hours. The temperature dips towards a chilly 8 degrees, with wind chill making it feel as if winter itself whispers at a biting -5. The northern winds twist and turn, occasionally gusting with a playful ferocity that reminds us of winter\u2019s grip. The chance of snow, though slim, lingers on the periphery, like a fleeting thought.\n\nLooking towards tomorrow, clouds will hover protectively, ensuring an unyielding chill persists. The high will only reach around 24 degrees, with the wind shifting to a resolute 17 mph, carving through the day. While the chance of snow remains modest, the atmospheric weight invites a sense of subdued serenity, perfect for an afternoon spent inside, perhaps nurturing a warm drink and reading a novel that beckons from a distant shelf. As the day unfolds, dressing warmly\u2014multiple layers, a sturdy coat, and perhaps a good pair of gloves\u2014would be wise for any excursion. So, whether you choose to stroll along an empty path or settle in for a cozy embrace at home, allow yourself to find peace in these quiet, wintry moments.",
