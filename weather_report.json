    "weather_report": "As night deepens over Boston, a tranquil calm settles onto the city. The air is crisp and cool, with a low of 27 degrees lingering just above the ground. The faint whispers of a westward breeze weave through the stillness, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude under the nearly clear sky. \n\nWith dawn approaching, expect a delightful Sunday bathed in sunlight. The day promises to warm gently, peaking near 57 degrees, enhanced by a soft southwest wind that will coax the chill from the morning air. A perfect opportunity to step outside, to wander aged streets or stroll along the waterfront, where the morning sun glimmers upon the water\u2019s surface. Dusk\u2019s chill may linger in the air, so dressing in layers\u2014a cozy sweater under a light jacket\u2014would suit the day perfectly. For those seeking a quieter pace, this could be the day to settle into a corner caf\u00e9 with an enticing book or to meander through the nearby parks, relishing the crisp autumn air and the leisurely rhythm of the day.",
