    "weather_report": "As midday unfolds in Boston, the air feels comfortably warm, draping the city in a gentle embrace of warmth reminiscent of a late spring day. A soft breeze from the southwest carries with it whispers of the trees, while the sky, partially painted with patches of sunlight, suggests a lingering playfulness despite the encroaching clouds. Although there\u2019s a hint of grey threatening to obscure the sun later in the evening, for now, the atmosphere remains refreshingly clear, inviting an afternoon stroll.\n\nAs the day wanes and clouds gather, the possibility of a light rain after midnight casts a gentle shadow over the evening plans. Those venturing out this afternoon might consider light layers\u2014perhaps a short-sleeved shirt paired with a light jacket or cardigan to fend off a cool breeze. The impending rain calls for practicality, so a compact umbrella tucked away might be wise. One could find joy in the city\u2019s parks, perhaps sharing a quiet moment with a book, or wandering along the Charles, watching the water as it mirrors the sky's evolving palette. Yet, as night approaches and temperatures dip, the allure of a cozy caf\u00e9 beckons, offering the warmth of a spot beside a window, watching the clouds roll in.",
