    "weather_report": "The afternoon unfolds in Boston with a gentle embrace of sunshine, illuminating the city beneath a deep blue expanse. The air carries whispers of warmth, inviting pedestrians to step outside and feel the subtle kiss of a light breeze from the east. As the hours trickle by, the warmth lingers, creating a perfect backdrop for leisurely strolls through the Commons or along the esplanade, where the shimmering water invites moments of quiet introspection.\n\nAs night descends, the sky will transition into a canvas of clarity, allowing the stars to emerge with a soft twinkle. The comfortable warmth will linger into the evening, perfect for those who prefer to linger outdoors, whether at a quaint caf\u00e9 or during a low-key gathering with friends. The soft south wind dances through the air, making light layers an ideal choice for a pleasant walk or an evening at a rooftop bar, where the views of the skyline merge beautifully with the soothing evening air. Tonight, one can embrace the charm of an evening spent under a clear sky, perhaps catching a glimpse of distant constellations as the day's warmth melts into a peaceful night.",
