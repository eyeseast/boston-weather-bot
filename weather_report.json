    "weather_report": "A gentle calm envelops Boston today, as the promise of sun unfolds in a largely clear sky, with only the remnants of early morning fog now vanished like a whisper. The gentle northeast breeze whispers through the leaves, bringing with it a refreshing feel, just cool enough to offset the warmth of the day ahead. Those planning outdoor activities will find the air agreeable, hovering around a comfortable mildness that invites leisurely strolls and quiet moments on sun-dappled benches. \n\nAs evening approaches, the clouds may roll in a little more, but the night promises to be equally pleasant, wrapping you in a light embrace as temperatures drop gently, urging you to cozy into a light layer as you embrace the lingering warmth of the day. This is a time for quiet reflection or perhaps a stroll along the Esplanade, where the fading light turns the water into silken ribbons of gold. For tonight, let the breeze guide you toward casual gatherings, where conversation flows as pleasantly as the evening air.",
