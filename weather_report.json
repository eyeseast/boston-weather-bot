    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Boston, the sky presents a splendid canvas of gentle blues, punctuated by wisps of cloud that float lazily in the refreshing breeze. With temperatures climbing towards a pleasant 78 degrees, one can almost feel the mild warmth coaxing the city\u2019s inhabitants to emerge from their shadows, seeking solace in the sunlit streets. The westerly winds, robust yet friendly, invite a hint of exhilaration into the air, their gusts whispering promises of adventure. Tonight, the fading sunlight will give way to a tranquil night, wrapping the city in a soft blanket of clear skies and mild temperatures around 55 degrees, perfect for an evening stroll or a quiet moment outdoors.\n\nIn such delightful weather, consider opting for light, airy fabrics that allow your skin to breathe, perhaps a well-worn linen shirt paired with comfortably tailored shorts. As the sun sets and the air cools, a light jacket or shawl will continue the warmth of the day into the early evening. It\u2019s a fine day to wander through the sprawling parks, catch up with a friend over an afternoon coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, or simply engage in a book beneath the vast open sky. This is the sort of day that beckons you to savor each moment, breathing in the finest that Boston has to offer in this golden light.",
