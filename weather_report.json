    "weather_report": "As the clock strikes midnight in Boston, a shroud of patchy fog envelops the city, whispering secrets only the night can convey. This delicate veil will hover until dawn, bringing with it a texture of intrigue and the promise of imminent weather that paints the sky with shades of gray. Through the early hours, showers and thunderstorms are expected, threading their way into the fabric of the night. For those who venture out, a light jacket might provide a comfortable shield against the dampness, complemented by sensible footwear to navigate the moisture-clad streets.\n\nAs the sun rises, the day will awaken with a sense of sultry heaviness, the air thickened by the humidity and the lingering fog. With a high near 73, the promise of continuous showers and the possibility of thunder will keep activities decidedly more subdued. Optimal plans might involve curling up in a cozy caf\u00e9, with a good book in hand, allowing time to drift by as the world outside dances with raindrops. For those seeking a spark of creativity, an afternoon spent exploring local galleries or libraries could infuse the day with inspiration. Dress warmly enough to weather the humidity, yet simply enough to appreciate the refuge of the indoors. Embrace the atmospheric embrace of this summer day, where nature dictates a slower rhythm, inviting contemplation and quiet joys.",
