    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Boston, the city holds a quiet promise of warmth and sun. The sky is partly cloudy, casting gentle shifts of shadow and light across the landscape. With temperatures expected to rise toward a comforting height of near 90 degrees, residents will find relief in a subtle southwest breeze that brings whispers of summer to their day. The heat index, reaching up to 97, will remind us that careful hydration is key as we embrace these longer, languorous hours of light. \n\nIn such pleasant summer conditions, it is advisable to dress lightly\u2014perhaps a breathable cotton shirt and comfortable shorts, allowing your skin to soak in that golden warmth without restraint. As the hours unfold, consider a stroll through the Public Garden or a leisurely visit to a nearby caf\u00e9, where you can enjoy a cool drink under the sprawling branches of shade trees. If your inclinations lean toward the artistic, make time for a gallery visit or gather with friends for a picnic in one of the city's welcoming parks. Today holds the potential for simple joys, and as the sun ascends, it invites all to partake in the easy pleasures that accompany a Boston summer day.",
