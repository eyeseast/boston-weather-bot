    "weather_report": "In Boston this afternoon, the sun is gracing the sky, illuminating the landscape with warm rays and casting soft shadows upon the bustling streets. With temperatures hovering comfortably around 73 degrees, it feels inviting to linger outdoors, where light breezes whisper through the trees, carrying the day\u2019s subtleties. The charm of the city unfurls beautifully under the bright blue expanse, offering a splendid opportunity to stroll along the harbor or perhaps indulge in a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9 terrace, savoring a chilled beverage while observing the lively rhythm of urban life.\n\nAs evening approaches, however, anticipation builds for a change. The clouds will soon gather, heralding the arrival of rain after the clock strikes two, cloaking the night in a damp embrace. With temperatures dropping to around 61, a light jacket may be wise, one that can withstand the gentle, persistent patter of rain. As the sky darkens and raindrops begin to dance upon rooftops, it may be a fitting time for some indoor reflection, perhaps delving into a good book or sharing a quiet meal with loved ones. A cozy evening awaits, rich with the scent of rain-soaked earth, promising warmth and comfort.",
