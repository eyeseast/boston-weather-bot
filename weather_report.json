    "weather_report": "As Boston basks in the warm embrace of a summer afternoon, the sun generously spills its golden rays upon the cityscape, casting a cheerful glow that hints at the kind of day that invites spontaneous outings and leisurely strolls. With a high near 91, the air feels thick with a gentle heat, coaxing city dwellers out of their homes to enjoy the vibrant urban life. A soft east wind whispers through the streets, adding a touch of comfort to the warmth, while the landscape appears mostly clear, dotted with a few fluffy clouds that seem to linger without a care in the world.\n\nThe night promises to unfold with equal charm, transitioning to mostly clear skies and a warm low around 71. As evening descends, the atmosphere will remain welcoming, ideal for unwinding with a stroll along the Charles River or perhaps sipping a cool beverage at a harbor-side caf\u00e9. Dressing in lightweight fabric is prudent, favoring breathable materials that allow for ease in the warmth of the day. As the golden light of late afternoon fades into dusk, consider gathering with friends for a relaxed dinner on a patio or losing yourself in a captivating book in a shady park, making the most of this delightful summer canvas painted across Boston\u2019s skies.",
