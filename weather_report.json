    "weather_report": "As the clock approaches the witching hour, Boston sinks deeper into the embrace of night, shrouded in a soft blanket of cloud cover and a lingering chill that permeates the air. The low murmur of the city\u2019s lights reflects off the clouds, creating a tableau of muted colors and gentle shadows across the landscape. Tonight carries with it the faintest promise of snow, a sprinkle of white that might wrap the world in a delicate hush by dawn. With temperatures dipping toward the mid-twenties, the northwest wind stirs lazily, urging those outdoors to wrap themselves warmly and perhaps reconsider evening strolls for the solace of a cozy nook.\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday, the city awakens to a forecast steeped in the potential for light snowfall, as clouds loom overhead, setting a scene perfect for muggy whispers of winter. The daytime presents a brisk, almost biting quality, with the high hovering just above freezing. A light jacket layered over a warm sweater will serve most well, complemented by a hat to fend off the crisp air that threatens to wander in through every seam. A lazy afternoon might invite locals to nestle in at a favorite cafe, where the warmth of coffee mingles with the chatter of conversations, or perhaps to visit a nearby gallery, where art can transport one away from the cold confines of outside. The day holds an invitation to enjoy the quiet delicacies of the season, perfect for those seeking a gentle escape amidst the muted bustle of a snow-kissed urban landscape.",
