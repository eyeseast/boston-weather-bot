    "weather_report": "As twilight gently envelops Boston, the air is tinged with the possibility of a passing shower that might delight those who find solace in the rhythm of falling raindrops. With the night settling in, a soft veil of clouds shrouds the sky, hinting at a low temperature around 59, mingling the warmth of the day with the cool whispers of evening. The subtle breeze, a gentle reminder of the season, beckons from the southwest, rustling leaves and carrying the scent of the city after a long day. \n\nTomorrow, be prepared for a day that dances between the sun's embrace and the lingering presence of clouds, with temperatures rising to a mild 72. As the sun breaks through the cloud cover in the afternoon, there looms the expectation of light rain showers, evoking images of bicycles gliding past blossoming parks or quiet corners of coffee shops where one might linger, reading a well-loved book. Attire should accommodate these gentle shifts; a light jacket or sweater may serve well in the morning chill, transitioning toward lighter garments as the day warms, while a compact umbrella could be a prudent companion. With these conditions in mind, consider a leisurely stroll along the Charles River or perhaps a visit to one of Boston's many eclectic markets, where the world flows in and out, much like the ever-changing weather above.",
