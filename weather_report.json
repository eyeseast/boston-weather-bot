The air is still, and the faintest whisper of rain looms\u2014an unwelcome reminder of uncertainty that hangs like a mist over the day. With temperatures dipping into the chilly depths of the morning, the atmosphere feels sharp, tinged with the promise of precipitation. The clouds will persist, thickening as the day unfolds, carrying with them the potential for rain and a lingering fog that lightly obscures the skyline, shrouding the city in an embrace both damp and dreary.\n\nAs morning shifts toward afternoon, expect the persistent rhythm of rain, punctuated by patches of fog that intertwine with the cool breeze. With a high struggling to reach the comforting warmth of early spring, it\u2019s a day best suited for fond layering\u2014a warm sweater beneath a waterproof jacket and sturdy boots to navigate the slick sidewalks. Although the weather may not coax one outdoors for exploration, it does offer an opportunity to cozy up in a favorite caf\u00e9, drinking in the aromas of freshly brewed coffee, perhaps indulging in the pages of a well-worn book while the world outside drips and mists. For those venturing out, a brisk walk with an umbrella may unveil the delicate beauty nestled within the fog, a quiet reminder of spring\u2019s hesitant arrival against a backdrop of soft, muted colors.",
