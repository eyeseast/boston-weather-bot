    "weather_report": "In Boston, a glorious day unfolds under a sun-drenched sky, where hues of blue stretch far into the horizon, promising warmth and vigor. The air is crisp, invigorating, albeit stirred by a spirited westward wind that dances through the trees, offering a refreshing embrace. As you prepare for the day, envision a comfortable layer, perhaps a cozy sweater or a light jacket, to shield against the brisk gusts that whirl from time to time. The afternoon promises delightful sunshine, inviting those who wish to wander along the Charles River or visit a local caf\u00e9 where laughter and lively conversation abound.\n\nTonight, the temperature will gently descend, cloaking the city in a soft layer of tranquility, as clouds drift in and out, allowing stars to peek through occasionally. This evening could be perfect for a leisurely stroll through well-lit streets or perhaps a simple gathering with friends over a board game or shared stories. The atmosphere, ideally suited for both adventure and contemplation, encourages you to savor the present moment as you glide into another serene Boston evening.",
