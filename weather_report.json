    "weather_report": "As the afternoon settles over Boston, a shroud of mist and rain envelops the streets, the clouds hanging low like an artist's brush smeared across the canvas of the sky. The air, thick with humidity and a damp chill, weaves through the alleys and thoroughfares, heralding the arrival of rain showers that are likely to continue throughout the day. With the temperature slipping from its brief peak, the world outside can feel subdued, making the vibrant hues of spring seem muted, almost melancholic. The northeast wind carries with it the promise of more rain, a promise that seems boundless, as the forecast suggests a relentless downpour continuing well into the night.\n\nSuch conditions call for a shift in plans; the allure of outdoor activities fades, replaced by the comfort of indoor pursuits. Cozying up with a good book at a favorite caf\u00e9 or revisiting an art gallery provides a soothing contrast to the rawness of the weather. When venturing out, one should dress thoughtfully\u2014a warm, waterproof coat, sturdy boots, and perhaps a scarf to wrap snugly against the damp air would be wise companions. Today is not one for haste but for reflection, as the world outside transforms into a wash of grays, inviting moments of stillness amidst nature's cleansing rain.",
