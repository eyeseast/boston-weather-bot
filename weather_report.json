    "weather_report": "Today in Boston, a hesitant sprinkle of snow whispers across the landscape before noon, as if the sky itself is considering a final touch of winter. The atmosphere is thick with clouds, draping the day in a muted gray, while a gentle north wind stirs, bringing a chill that settles around you like a barely woven shawl. The high rests near a numbing thirty-four, a reminder of winter's lingering grasp, while the evening promises a crisp low of seventeen. Tonight, the clouds might part slightly, revealing glimpses of starlight as the day yields to a quiet night.\n\nIn these brisk conditions, it's wise to bundle up; a warm coat, scarf, and perhaps a woolen cap will offer a comforting embrace against the cold. As you slip into your day, consider a thoughtful stroll through one of the many neighborhood parks, where the quiet realms of snow-dusted branches create an enchanting winter tapestry. Alternatively, seek refuge in a cozy caf\u00e9, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and sweet pastries wrapping around you like a cherished memory. Engage in gentle conversations or lose yourself in pages of a well-loved book as the world outside remains hushed and dreamlike.",
