The low temperatures offer a serene pause before dawn\u2019s early light breaks. In the quiet hours, a gentle breeze is stirring, promising restful moments for those who enjoy the simplicity of an evening stroll, where the glow of distant lights twinkle like stars on earth.\n\nCome Tuesday, a sun-drenched day unfolds with an invigorating brightness, casting long shadows and warming the air to a balmy heat. The sky will stretch wide and clear, reminiscent of a great canvas painted in rich hues, perfect for savoring the splendor of summer. Those venturing outdoors might find it pleasant\u2014yet imperative to dress appropriately, veering towards light fabrics that breathe, paired with a sun hat to shield from the bold rays.
