Currently, the air is cool, hovering near the brisk 37 degrees\u2014the kind of chill that whispers of winter\u2019s lingering breath, even though spring is at the doorstep. A gentle southwest wind rustles the trees, offering a soothing, rhythmic lullaby, while the cloudy expanse above wraps the town in a muted embrace. The interplay of fog and soft cloud cover transforms familiar landmarks into shadows, inviting a contemplative stroll along the quieter streets.\n\nLooking toward the morrow, the fog will ebb, allowing the sun to break through with a promise of mostly sunny skies. The temperature will rise toward a moderate high of around 53 degrees, making it an ideal day for casual errands or light outdoor pursuits. As you step into the brightness, consider layers\u2014perhaps a cozy sweater beneath a light jacket, perfect for transitioning from the cool morning to the gentle warmth of the afternoon. A path through one of Boston\u2019s scenic parks beckons, favoring a leisurely walk or a quiet moment by the water\u2019s edge, where the city's heartbeat slows, inviting you to savor the serenity before life resumes its hurried pace.",
