    "weather_report": "In the heart of Boston, a gentle breeze stirs the air, carrying with it a promise of a pleasantly warm afternoon. The sky, a pleasing expanse of daylight blue punctuated by fluffy clouds, hints at the warmth of the sun without overwhelming brightness. With temperatures hovering around a comfortable 66 degrees, today is one of those rare moments where spring teeters on the brink of summer, inviting inhabitants to step outside and enjoy the charm of the day. While the wind picks up, rustling the leaves and encouraging nearby trees to dance, one might find joy in a leisurely walk through the Public Garden or a quiet moment spent sipping coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the sky will clear, revealing a soothing wash of stars against the cool backdrop of night. A relaxed night awaits with temperatures settling around 48 degrees. For those venturing out, a light jacket should do well against the soft southwest breeze. Evening gatherings with friends, whether around a fire pit in a backyard or a stroll along the Charles River, will be further enhanced by the crispness of the air, turning ordinary moments into delightful experiences. Embrace the day with simple pleasures, for the world feels just right today.",
