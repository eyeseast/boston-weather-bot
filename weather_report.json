A brisk northwest wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it a reminder of the chill in the air, dipping down to a nippy 29 degrees. For those venturing out into the nocturnal expanse, a warm coat, perhaps layered with a scarf, would provide comfort against the gusts swirling about.\n\nAs dawn breaks into Sunday, the promise of sun brightens the day ahead, lifting spirits and warming faces. With clearer skies, the temperatures will rise, reaching a pleasant 46 degrees by midday. The winds may still flutter about, gentle but persistent, encouraging a brisk walk along the Charles or a peaceful moment in one of Boston\u2019s parks. As the city awakens, it invites its dwellers to sip coffee at a local caf\u00e9, indulging in the slow pleasure of the morning. Dress comfortably in layers to appreciate the sunshine while staying prepared for the lingering chill, and embrace the hum of life that thrives in this historic city on a bright, blustery Sunday.",
