    "weather_report": "In Boston, the afternoon unfolds with a warm embrace, the sun casting its golden glow upon the city. A gentle breeze stirs, providing a subtle relief from the heat as temperatures edge toward the mid-nineties. One might find an intricate play of light and shadows dancing in the sky, hinting at scattered clouds that, while softening the sun's intensity, do little to dampen the day's spirit. Though a brief whisper of rain is slated for the hours that follow, it carries a mere twenty percent chance, like a distant memory of a passing storm. This evening promises a transition into a more temperate night, where the warmth lingers just long enough to coax out comfortable gatherings under the stars.\n\nAs one steps outside, light cottons or breathable linens serve as the ideal attire, perfectly suited for such radiant warmth. Engaging in leisurely strolls along the Charles River or perhaps a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9 for an afternoon tea would be delightful options. As twilight approaches, the soft glow of city lights allows for leisurely exploration, whether it be a quiet wander through the streets or a chance to meet friends. Though the whispers of potential rain linger on the horizon, they do little to overshadow the day's inviting warmth.",
