    "weather_report": "As night envelops Boston, an opaque veil of clouds hangs above, casting a muted shadow over the city's skyline. The low temperature drifts around 35 degrees, a chill mingling with the brisk westerly winds that whisper between 6 to 14 mph. The evening air carries a certain stillness, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves, hinting at the movement of the night. The streets, illuminated by scattered lights, beckon those who find solace in an evening walk, perhaps along the Charles River, where the reflections shimmer gently, embracing the quiet of the hour.\n\nAs Tuesday dawns, the promise of a mostly sunny day emerges, although the air will remain crisp, with temperatures dipping to around 32 in the afternoon. The northwest wind, more pronounced at 7 to 20 mph, may bite at the skin, encouraging thoughtful layering. A cozy scarf and a warm jacket will be essential companions, shielding against the gusts as one ventures out. It\u2019s a day where the allure of a caf\u00e9 beckons; a warm cup of coffee enjoyed while nestled by a window could provide the perfect respite, allowing the day to unfold at a leisurely pace. For those who prefer outdoor pursuits, a walk through the emerald parks may just be invigorating enough to spark a sense of renewal, even as the afternoon chill sets in.",
