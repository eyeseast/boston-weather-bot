    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the atmosphere carries a certain heaviness, the skies cloaked in a mosaic of grays suggestive of an impending change. As the afternoon warms up to a soft 66 degrees, a persistent breeze breathes life into the scene, while the clouds gather strength, hinting at the rain that will soon drape the city. The clarity is subdued, with only fleeting glimpses of brightness struggling to break through the thickening layers above. \n\nAs night approaches, a gentle rain will begin to fall, a rhythmic patter that invites a cozy reprieve indoors. With temperatures dropping to a mild 55, dressing in softer fabrics, perhaps a light waterproof jacket and a comfortable pair of shoes, would be wise. This is a night perfect for slipping into a favorite caf\u00e9 with a book in hand or gathering with friends for an evening of conversation and warmth. The sounds of rain against windows will provide a soothing backdrop, making the world outside seem all the more distant and tranquil.",
