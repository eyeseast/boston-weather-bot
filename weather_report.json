    "weather_report": "Boston awakens to a day that promises warmth beneath a canvas of mostly sunny skies. The gentle southwest breeze whispers through the streets, bringing with it a hint of anticipation for a pleasant afternoon, as the city basks in a high approaching the comfort of 87 degrees. Although the horizon seems muted, with a delicate veil of haze tingeing the landscape, the sun\u2019s potential remains steadfast, ready to shine through as the morning unfolds. \n\nAs the day progresses, the weather holds a promise of refreshing clarity, transitioning into a beautifully serene evening where the temperature will gracefully descend to about 62 degrees. With the evening light casting a soft glow, it\u2019s an opportune time to stroll through the parks, perhaps wander to a favorite caf\u00e9 for a calm moment with a book. Dressing in lightweight layers will keep one comfortable\u2014from a breathable shirt to a light jacket for as the sun dips behind the buildings. Today invites leisurely pursuits: a quiet walk along the Charles River or an outdoor gathering with friends would complement the inviting weather beautifully.",
