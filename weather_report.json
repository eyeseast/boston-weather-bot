    "weather_report": "In the tender hours of the early morning, Boston is shrouded in a veil of clouds, offering a dance of uncertainty between snowflakes and wisps of moisture that conspire to elevate the air to a barely noticeable warmth. The chill lingers at around 25 degrees, a crispness nudged upward by a gentle south wind. As daylight beckons, the atmosphere remains murky, cloaked in an enigmatic haze that challenges its clarity, a fleeting lingering of tired night, hinting at snow before dawn breaks. \n\nAs Monday unfolds, the promise of warmth grows, with clouds gathering amidst a reluctant sun, swirling about a high of 44 degrees. This weather calls for layers: a sturdy coat over a soft sweater, perhaps a scarf to insulate against the breath of winter still in the air. For those considering their day, the canvas of weather invites leisurely strolls through local parks or quiet moments in cozy caf\u00e9s, where warm drinks and soft pastries beckon. It is a day for reflection rather than rush, a perfect opportunity for the comfort of familiar routine amid the sometimes melancholic beauty of a winter sky.",
