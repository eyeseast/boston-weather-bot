    "weather_report": "This afternoon in Boston unfolds with a gentle embrace of warmth, the high reaching near 81 degrees, inviting those outdoors to bask in the soft light filtering through the partly sunny skies. A subtle breeze from the southeast, tracing its path through the air at a relaxed pace, stirs the leaves, urging passersby to pause and savor each moment. However, as the day progresses toward evening, the clouds will not abandon entirely their vigil, transforming into a partly cloudy haven by nightfall, when temperatures will graciously dip to around 61 degrees.\n\nIn this pleasant tableau, the day beckons for leisurely strolls along the Charles River, where the rhythmic lapping of water against the shore harmonizes with the laughter of children playing nearby. Perhaps a visit to a quaint caf\u00e9, where one could linger over a delightful book, would be the perfect way to indulge in the serenity that reigns in the air. Light layers will serve well; a comfortable shirt complemented by a light sweater for later, as the evening air cools, will ensure one remains cozy while still reveling in the beauty of the evening sky. The ambiance holds a promise not just of warmth, but of restful contemplation, making any mundane errand feel like a cherished adventure.",
