    "weather_report": "As evening unfolds in Boston, a blanket of clouds envelops the skyline, softly muting the city\u2019s lights and lending a reflective quality to the air. The temperature drifts towards a cool embrace of 47 degrees, while a gentle east wind whispers around 10 mph, occasionally stirring up brief gusts that dance to 25 mph. There\u2019s a hushed expectation of rain, with a slight possibility for a few drops to grace the evening, barely noticeable against the backdrop of the persistent clouds.\n\nLooking ahead to Thursday, the city is poised for a day steeped in gray, where rain will weave its way through the morning, transforming into a steady rhythm against the rooftops and sidewalks. Patchy fog may curl around corners, inviting a sense of introspection as you navigate the dampened streets. With temperatures lingering near 51 degrees and a steady breeze clocking in at 12 to 18 mph, the atmosphere may feel lively yet damp. Given these conditions, a thoughtful layering of clothing\u2014a light waterproof jacket paired with a comfortable sweater\u2014will serve well against the chill of both air and rain. As you consider plans, it might be the perfect day to find refuge in a cozy caf\u00e9, where the aroma of brewing coffee mingles with soft murmurs, inviting you to lose track of time among the pages of a book or the gentle drumbeat of conversation. Embrace the quiet charm of this rainy day, as it offers moments of solitude and reflection amid the rhythms of urban life.",
