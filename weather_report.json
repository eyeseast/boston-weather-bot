    "weather_report": "In Boston today, a touch of unpredictability looms in the air, with hints of warmth trying to break through the clouded sky. As the afternoon approaches, you may encounter a fleeting sprinkle of rain, a reminder of winter\u2019s lingering grip before it eventually yields. Those venturing outdoors should prepare for a brisk experience, as a steady southwest wind carries a chill, eager to remind you to layer up before stepping out. While you might catch glimpses of sun, it's best to don a warm jacket, maybe even a scarf, to ward off the biting gusts. \n\nAs the day meanders toward evening, skies will clear, but don\u2019t expect a balmy farewell; temperatures will dive into the depths of winter\u2019s embrace. With the air growing crisper, it\u2019s an ideal time to find solace in a cozy caf\u00e9, where the warmth of a drink cradles your hands, or perhaps to enjoy a stroll along the waterfront, wrapped snugly in your attire. Today offers moments of light amidst the chill, inviting quiet reflection on the changing season while the wind whispers stories of spring just around the corner.",
