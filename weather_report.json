    "weather_report": "A sultry afternoon envelops Boston, with the sun gleaming brightly overhead, casting a golden hue on the bustling streets. The warmth wraps around you like a soft embrace, hinting at the high temperatures nearing 93 degrees. It\u2019s as if the air itself conspires with the heat, creating a subtle haze that blurs the edges of distant structures and quilts the horizon in a dreamy shimmer. For those stepping outside, light fabrics will offer the best solace; a breezy shirt or perhaps a flowing sundress can keep you comfortable against the day\u2019s intensity. \n\nAs night descends, a transition awaits: the sky will cloak itself in a veil of clouds, and the chance of showers and thunderstorms looms on the horizon, whispering promises of refreshing rains. Settling into the evening, the faint aroma of earth after rainfall may grace the air, mingling with the lingering warmth from the day. Should you be out and about, a light jacket may serve you well as patchy fog rolls in, adding a touch of mystery to the surroundings. The chance to catch a summer thunderstorm may very well awaken the senses, offering a spectacle of nature\u2019s raw energy. In this evening\u2019s embrace, consider seeking out cozy places where one can relax and listen to the melody of the rain, as Boston prepares for a night painted in delicate shades of possibility.",
