    "weather_report": "As midnight settles over Boston, the city is embraced in a tranquil darkness, punctuated only by the distant glow of streetlights and the soft thrum of life that continues to pulse in the night. The air is crisp, an embrace of coolness that lingers as temperatures hover around 40 degrees, invigorating yet demanding a protective layer. A brisk west wind rustles through the empty streets, its presence felt in gusts, carrying with it the promise of clarity ahead. \n\nTomorrow greets us with the sun peeking through, announcing a day where shadows will dance beneath a mostly sunny sky. The temperature will gently rise to about 52 degrees, inviting you to shed the heavier winter cloaks in favor of lighter layers. A scarf or sweater will offer comfort against the playful grabs of the wind, while sturdy shoes will serve well for those strolling along the cobblestone paths or exploring quiet corners of this historic city. Amidst this embracing warmth of the day\u2019s sun, one might find joy in a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9, savoring the aroma of rich coffee warming both hands and heart, or perhaps peruse a bookstore, enveloped by the written word as the world awakens outside.",
