Expect rain showers to weave in and out before the clock strikes nine, following which a persistent rhythm of droplets and patchy fog will envelop the streets. Temperatures hover around a cool 50 degrees, carrying on the wind's soft caress, urging passersby to don layers that are both cozy and functional. A light, eastward breeze stirs the air, hinting at the dampness that the evening promises.\n\nAs we ease into tomorrow, a continuation of this drizzly embrace awaits, with clouds lingering overhead and fog painting soft silhouettes across the horizon. With highs reaching near 57, the atmosphere will likely feel brisk yet manageable, inviting you to wrap yourself in your favorite sweater as you venture out. This kind of weather is perfect for quiet moments spent immersed in a book at a local caf\u00e9, or perhaps a stroll under an umbrella, appreciating the sound of rain-kissed leaves. The charm of a rainy day lies in the small joys it brings\u2014finding warmth indoors or embracing the refreshing scent of rain-soaked streets.",
