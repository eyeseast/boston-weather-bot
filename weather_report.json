    "weather_report": "As the night lingers in Boston, the world outside is shrouded in rain showers and a veil of fog, a melancholy embrace that softens the edges of the city. Cool and clammy, the air wraps around you like a damp scarf, urging you to find comfort indoors. The temperature holds a gentle promise of about 61, muting the vibrant pulse of summer but providing a refreshing break from the heat. With rain whispering against the windowpanes, it\u2019s decidedly the kind of night that calls for cozy blankets and warm cups of tea, perhaps with a touch of honey to chase away the chill. \n\nAs dawn breaks into tomorrow, the clouds may shift to reveal fleeting glimpses of sunlight, yet those rain showers are hanging on. Highs will reach around 70, rendering the day an inviting balance of warmth punctuated by the remnants of early rains. Those venturing outside should consider a light jacket for the morning fog. A stroll through a nearly deserted park, listening to the soft symphony of raindrops on leaves, could offer a serenely reflective start to the day\u2014ideal for literary musings or quiet thought. As the sun stretches its arms and the skies brighten, the splashes of rain will invigorate the bustling life of the city, allowing for the simple joys of a caf\u00e9 stop, as you watch life unfold from a warm corner.",
