    "weather_report": "As the early morning hours settle over Boston, the city rests under a blanket of cloud cover, casting a muted light across the streets. The temperature hovers in the chill of the night, a brisk 26 degrees that hints at the imminent arrival of sunrise. The northwest wind whispers softly, barely stirring the air, yet enough to remind the mindful that warmth is a luxury soon to be claimed with the sun\u2019s ascent. \n\nCome Friday, a transformation awaits. The clouds will dissipate, yielding to a canvas of bright blue, and the day promises a refreshing high around 55 degrees. This shift in weather invites one to step outside, basking in not just sunlight, but also the gentle breeze stirring the leaves. For those venturing beyond their door, layering up will be wise; a cozy sweater under a light jacket will provide comfort against the morning chill while allowing for the embrace of warmer air as the day unfolds. With the promise of pleasant weather, activities such as wandering along the Charles River, exploring a hidden caf\u00e9, or stopping by local markets will prove delightful. A stroll to soak in the autumn hues, or simply enjoying a moment with a book at a nearby park, will foster a connection with the beauty enveloping this historic city as it awakens anew.",
