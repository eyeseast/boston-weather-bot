    "weather_report": "As the evening unfolds over Boston, the sky drapes itself in a cloak of clouds, shadows dancing softly across the cityscape. The chill of the night seeps in, wrapping everything in a brisk embrace as temperatures hover in the low teens. There is a stillness that permeates the air, punctuated only by the occasional whisper of a northwest wind, stirring momentarily before retreating into the quiet. \n\nUpon the morrow, the weather introduces a touch of winter's whimsy, hinting at the possibility of snow after mid-afternoon. The clouds will remain, creating a muted canvas above, but there is a small chance that flakes will begin to fall, beckoning those who are inclined to embrace the chill with light laughter and warm coats. The forecast suggests a day best suited for layered attire\u2014perhaps a knitted scarf, a snug hat, and sturdy gloves; things one can easily don before heading out for a brisk walk or a leisurely visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with sweet pastries, inviting one to linger a little longer. As night descends once more, the city will sparkle beneath the overcast sky, a gentle reminder of the warmth to be found in shared spaces, making it an ideal time to gather with friends, recounting tales as the evening glides on.",
