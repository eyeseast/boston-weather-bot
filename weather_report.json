As temperatures find their low around 68, a gentle south wind stirs, breathing life into the night\u2014a soft promise of warmth that lingers on the skin. The day ahead suggests an intriguing shift; while Saturday will greet the city with mostly sunny conditions, those desiring to relish in the outdoors should be prepared for the possibility of light rain showers as the clock ticks towards the late afternoon.\n\nAs the sun ascends, the warmth will build, possibly leading to a high of nearly 87 before the evening softens the heat to a comfortable 81. In this transitional moment, it is advisable to don breathable fabrics, perhaps a light shirt paired with easy trousers or a flowing dress. The vibrant air beckons you outdoors\u2014perhaps a quiet stroll along the Charles or finding a cozy caf\u00e9 for a cup of coffee, where the scent of roasted beans dances with the lingering warmth of summer. Just remember, as the day meanders onward, a light jacket may become a welcome companion if the evening unfolds as predicted with those fleeting rain showers.",
