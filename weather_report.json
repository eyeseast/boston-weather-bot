    "weather_report": "As the day unfolds over Boston, a shroud of gray clouds blankets the city, lending an air of subdued calm. This afternoon, the temperature hovers around a cool 46 degrees, with a gentle east wind that nudges through the streets, whispering the promise of an impending change. By tonight, the atmosphere will shift dramatically, as rain begins to softly patter against windows after midnight, cloaked in the comfort of a dreary yet nurturing embrace. The city seems to hunker down, with an unwavering 100% chance of precipitation forecasted, perhaps inviting moments of reflection indoors as the world outside transforms into a watercolor wash of muted tones.\n\nFor those venturing out in the waning daylight, a layered approach to dressing will serve you well. A sturdy jacket, perhaps one that offers both warmth and some protection against the anticipated drizzle, should shield you from both the cool breeze and the chill of the rain. Perhaps a woolen scarf wrapped snugly around the neck will provide added comfort as the evening settles in. While this weather may not beckon for picnics at the park or strolls along the waterfront, it creates an inviting backdrop for intimate gatherings\u2014a cozy evening spent with a good book enveloped by the soft sound of raindrops, or a delightful evening engaged in conversation over warm cups of tea with friends.",
