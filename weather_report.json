    "weather_report": "The afternoon in Boston unfolds under a blanket of cloud cover, a landscape draped in muted shades as the temperature struggles to reach a frigid 29 degrees. As the day wanes, a subtle hint of snowflakes flirts with the air, whispering against the light south wind. The atmosphere feels heavy with anticipation, a promise of winter\u2019s handiwork \u2013 a chance of snow lingers like a distant memory waiting to materialize. The chance of precipitation swells to a robust 70% as evening draws near, beckoning thicker fog that will envelop the city, dissolving the clarity of distant outlines into soft, indistinct shapes.\n\nAs night descends, a chill fosters cozy indoor aspirations; the predicted low of 24 degrees carries a biting edge, especially with gentle breezes making their presence felt. Thus, it might be prudent to layer warmly, favoring thick scarves and mittens against the cold, while still allowing freedom of movement to navigate a city that, under the veil of fog and soft snowfall, invites contemplative strolls or the simple delight of a quiet coffee shop. This evening holds space for reflective moments, perhaps a quiet read or a leisurely window-side watch at a local caf\u00e9 where the world outside softens, and the hum of activity fades into the comforting background of steaming cups and murmured conversations.",
