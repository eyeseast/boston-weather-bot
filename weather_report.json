    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Boston, a crisp chill wraps itself around the city like a gentle reminder of winter's lingering embrace. Tonight's sky remains mostly clear, revealing the brilliant stars that dot the cold expanse above. The air carries a sharpness, with gusty winds that underscore the approaching night, making one feel the bite of the season. With temperatures dipping to around 23 degrees, a sturdy jacket is essential, layered perhaps with a scarf to keep the brisk air at bay. The urban landscape is illuminated, the lights reflecting off the darkened surfaces, creating an intimate glow against the stark chill.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, the promise of a slightly warmer day offers a sense of renewal. A modest chance of rain showers after noon looms gently on the horizon, but for the early part of the day, the sun may grace us with its presence, peeking through with the clarity of promising spring. The high temperature reaches toward 46, inviting the wanderer to explore the city's parks or meander through its historic streets. A light sweater should suffice under the jacket, as the winds will continue to whisper their coolness. A stroll along the Charles River or a relaxed visit to a favorite caf\u00e9 sounds just right, providing comfort against the gentle shifts of early spring weather.",
