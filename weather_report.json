    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens its embrace over Boston, the skyline is wrapped in a veil of clouds illuminated by scattered lights. The air is crisp; tonight's chill whispers promises of frost as temperatures dip toward the low teens. A gentle but persistent northwest wind dances among the streets, its gusts stirring the quiet and sending a shiver through any unguarded layers. Yet, this evening's ambiance possesses a certain charm, a reminder of winter's hold on the city, where cozy pursuits beckon\u2014perhaps a warm cup of tea enjoyed in a favorite nook or a leisurely stroll to embrace the brisk air.\n\nTomorrow, dawn will wash the city in golden sunlight, banishing the shadows of night and inviting a refreshing warmth. With the high expected to reach the mid-twenties, the day beckons one to venture outside, perhaps for a walk along the Charles River or a visit to a local caf\u00e9 for a pastry and a moment of reflection. Dressing in layers will be essential; consider a soft wool sweater paired with a sturdy coat, complemented by a knitted scarf and gloves to stave off the lingering chill of dawn. The forecast speaks of clarity, a serene, sunny day that hums with the potential for simple pleasures\u2014be it reading a book in a sunlit park or exploring the cobblestone streets of Beacon Hill.",
