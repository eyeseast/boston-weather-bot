    "weather_report": "As twilight settles over Boston this evening, the air is turning humid, carrying a whisper of rains yet to come. Currently, the city lies beneath a blanket of clouds, cloaked in the muted glow of urban lights, with the temperature draping itself around a comfortable 56 degrees. A gentle southeast breeze sways lightly through the trees, its strength promising that something more dramatic lurks beyond the horizon. Expect a chance of rain that will likely become more pronounced as the clock ticks towards dawn, with the night hinting at a restless sky.\n\nAs we glide into Monday, prepare for a day shrouded in the heavy embrace of clouds, punctuated by a symphony of rain showers and the rumble of distant thunder. The atmosphere will feel charged, the clouds swelling with the anticipation of heavy downpours. Although the highs may flirt with a warm 67 degrees, there\u2019s a likelihood of temperatures gradually retreating as the storm systems roll in. Appropriate attire may include waterproof layers and sturdy footwear, guiding one through puddled streets or sheltered spots\u2014perhaps a cozy caf\u00e9 where the world outside softens in the rain. While the broader world may seem dreary, the scent of rain-soaked earth and the chance for thunderous drama provide an invitation for quiet introspection, a reading nook beside a window, or a simple watch as nature orchestrates its own kind of performance.",
