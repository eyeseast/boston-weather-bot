    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Boston, a tapestry of warmth and moisture wraps the city. The air is thick, heavy with the promise of scattered showers and the distant rumble of thunderstorms lurking like whispers on the horizon. The sun breaks through in patches, casting a shimmering light upon the streets, while the humidity paints the day with a sultriness that carries the vibe of a sultry summer picnic interrupted by a sudden storm. The temperatures flirt with the high nineties, but the heat index pushes those feelings to near discomfort, urging you to seek the shade or the coolness of a chilled drink.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the weather hints at a change, with a higher likelihood of storms swelling in the sky, roiling clouds gathering strength as they drift southward. Those plans for an evening stroll should be revisited, replaced by an invitation to nestle into a cozy chair with a good book or explore the local coffee shops, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the distant sound of thunder. Deck yourself in light and breathable fabrics, perhaps a loose shirt and comfortable shorts, and carry an umbrella\u2014just in case\u2014as you navigate the evening\u2019s impending humidity and warmth.",
