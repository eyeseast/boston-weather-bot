    "weather_report": "As evening descends on Boston, the air carries a gentle whisper of coolness, with temperatures settling comfortably around fifty-seven degrees. The clouds drape the sky in a muted gray, hinting at the slight chance of drizzle that may grace us after dawn, a dance of moisture in the air as the city tumbles into night. A soft northeast breeze brushes by, just enough to remind you of the warmth you might still want to embrace tomorrow.\n\nThe forecast for Wednesday suggests a further continuation of this subdued ambiance, with a promise of drizzle that lingers like a half-formed thought. With a high near sixty-two, the day will be shrouded in clouds, casting a gentle shadow over any ambitions of bright sunshine. It would be wise to dress in layers, perhaps a light jacket or a cozy sweater providing companionship against the dampness. A scarf would not go amiss, as the chill may settle in, while a sturdy umbrella might serve as a trusty sidekick for those venturing out. As you consider your plans, perhaps a stroll through the stillness of the Common, where the trees wear their twilight colors, or a visit to a tucked-away caf\u00e9 could offer a soothing retreat, perfect for embracing the quiet magic of the day.",
