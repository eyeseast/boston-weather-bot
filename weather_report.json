    "weather_report": "As dusk envelops Boston, the day draws to a close with the soft embrace of a partly sunny afternoon giving way to the whisper of evening. The lingering warmth, with temperatures at a comfortable 83, invites you to linger outdoors just a little longer. A gentle east wind carries a hint of summer, but as night unfolds, it brings subtle changes \u2014 the sky becoming a canvas of muted colors as clouds dance lazily above, hinting at the patchy fog that will settle in once the moon graces its throne in the twilight. \n\nAs the temperature eases to around 67, a sense of tranquility blankets the city. While the warmth of day lingers, clothe yourself in layers, perhaps a light sweater that captures both the warmth of the day and the coolness of night. Imagine strolling along the waterfront as the first stars begin to twinkle, or contemplating the soft fog curling in around familiar streets. It\u2019s a moment to savor quietly, perhaps with a good book in a cozy caf\u00e9, or a gentle walk through the parks, where fireflies flicker like whispers in the darkening hues of summer.",
