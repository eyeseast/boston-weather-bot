    "weather_report": "This evening in Boston, a steady drizzle falls under a thick blanket of cloud, casting a muted gray palette across the city. The air is cool, with a hint of dampness that wraps around as the temperatures dip toward the low fifties. A gentle breeze brushes through the streets, occasionally rising in gusts, reminding passersby of the need to embrace warmer clothing. As you step outside, consider donning a sturdy raincoat and perhaps some waterproof shoes to navigate the puddles that will surely form in the hours to come. \n\nTomorrow brings the likelihood of continued rain, especially before the clock strikes five. The clouds are reluctant to part, though a promise of slightly milder temperatures dances on the horizon. As the rain wanes throughout the day, the mist rising from the ground will create a serene atmosphere perfect for a contemplative stroll through Boston's quieter neighborhoods or perhaps a visit to an inviting caf\u00e9 where warmth and comfort await. Those with an inclination for the indoors may find solace in indulging in a good book or exploring local art, making for a pleasantly unhurried day despite the weather's chill.",
