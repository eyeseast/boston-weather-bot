    "weather_report": "As the clock gently chimes the midnight hour in Boston, the night is cloaked in a shroud of clouds, bringing a tangible anticipation of rain. The winds whisper through the streets, carrying the scent of damp earth, and the air holds a slight chill, with temperatures settling around 49 degrees. Those who venture outdoors may feel the gentle patter of early rain showers, a promising prelude to the more active weather that lies ahead. With overnight precipitation predicted, a cautious spirit navigating these wet beginnings may need to embrace a reliable raincoat, perhaps paired with comfortable boots\u2014perfect for both puddle splashes and late-night coffee runs.\n\nAs dawn breaks, expect a mix of sunlight and lingering clouds to paint the sky, giving way to warmer breezes. The chance of rain diminishes, offering a glimpse of a high near 73, which should coax many outdoors. The day beckons with its whispers of possibility; a stroll along the Charles may awaken one\u2019s senses, as the season breathes new life into the landscape. An afternoon spent savoring quiet moments in a park or perhaps discovering that tucked-away caf\u00e9 might just provide the best remedies for a drizzly start. Dress warmly, but if the clouds finally part in favor of sunshine, layering will allow for comfort in the gentle shift of spring.",
