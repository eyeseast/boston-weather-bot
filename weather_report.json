    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, a blanket of quiet snow envelopes the city, casting a soft hush throughout the streets. The day is wrapped in a shroud of clouds, offering only a whisper of light as snow showers linger before noon. With temperatures hovering around a chilly 35 degrees, a gentle west wind brushes against your face, urging you to button up and seek warmth. The promise of a fresh dusting of snow, albeit modest, glimmers like a hidden treasure among the solemn gray. \n\nAs the day progresses, the skies are expected to clear, transforming into a crisp evening with temperatures dipping to around 17 degrees, where the chill seeks out any unprepared skin. A brisk southwest wind will add an invigorating bite, suggesting that it would be wise to don a sturdy coat, warm gloves, and perhaps a well-fitted scarf for that quick jaunt outside. With this wintry tapestry, consider a leisurely stroll through local streets as the sun dips low, allowing the golden hour to cast an enchanting glow on freshly fallen snow. Or perhaps a quiet afternoon inside, with a good book and a hot drink, would be the perfect refuge from the cold. Embrace the winter's embrace, as it offers both beauty and a chance to indulge in the simple pleasures of the season.",
