    "weather_report": "In Boston, the afternoon unfolds with a gentle warmth, as patches of sunlight dance playfully with the drifting clouds overhead. A brisk west wind whispers through the streets, its subtle chill a reminder that winter is fading, but not yet forgotten. The skies are punctuated by cottony clouds that create a patchwork of shadows upon the city, adding depth to the already stunning landscape. As the day progresses, the mercury is expected to rise, inviting residents to shed the last remnants of their winter coats, though a light layer would still offer comfort against the breezy gusts.\n\nTonight, the clouds will give way to a more serene tableau, transitioning to a partly cloudy night where the stars may shyly peek through the veil of darkness. With temperatures dipping to a comfortable coolness, one might find solace in a cozy evening stroll or perhaps a gathering with friends over steaming cups of coffee. The weather favors relaxed, leisurely activities; perhaps a visit to a nearby park or an exploration of a quaint bookstore would be perfect ways to savor the day's offerings, striking a harmonious balance between the cusp of winter and the promise of spring.",
