    "weather_report": "As night envelops Boston, the cool, damp air settles in, whispering with the promise of patchy fog that will grace the pre-dawn hours. Tonight's atmosphere is accompanied by a hint of rain, a subtle reminder of the shifting seasons, as temperatures slowly unfurl from a low of 46 to a milder 53. South winds weave gently through the city, offering a soft embrace for those who venture outside, though a slight chance of precipitation hangs in the air like a distant memory.\n\nTomorrow dawns with the prospect of lingering fog that may color the morning with a dreamlike haze. As the sun rises above the horizon, the clouds will swirl and part to make way for a high near 65, inviting Bostonians to enjoy the day with a mix of clarity and cloudiness. To make the most of the changing weather, a light jacket would serve well, particularly for the bustling midday, where brisk winds reach up to 17 mph. This is an excellent opportunity to meander through the local markets or perhaps find solace in a favorite caf\u00e9, sipping something warm and nourishing as the day unfolds. With the landscape fluctuating and the air rich with possibilities, this Sunday beckons a gentle exploration of both familiar and unknown spaces, allowing one to breathe in the crispness of spring's approach.",
