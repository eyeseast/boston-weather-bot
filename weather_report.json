    "weather_report": "As Boston slips into the cool embrace of night, a gentle whisper of a breeze carries the promise of change. The skies hover partly cloudy, with certainty lingering just above the 53-degree threshold. The evening feels tranquil, punctuated only by the soft rustling of leaves and the distant hum of the city that never sleeps. The air is mild yet carries a hint of warmth, inviting those out for a late stroll or an impromptu chat under the stars.\n\nLooking ahead to the day in store, one can sense a touch of ambivalence. While the morning may dawn only partly sunny, hints of rain may flutter in after the workday begins to fade at around 4 PM. Anticipate a soothing warmth, as the afternoon climbs to approximately 72 degrees before retracing its steps into the 60s. Dress accordingly: a light layer to ward off the morning chill, perhaps with the foresight of a light raincoat should you find yourself swept up in the rhythm of raindrops come evening. Embrace the city\u2019s vibrant pulse by exploring a local caf\u00e9 or perusing hidden bookstores as the clouds play their game of peek-a-boo. Whatever you choose, it promises to be a day that reminds you of the subtle beauty of transition.",
