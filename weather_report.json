    "weather_report": "As the clock strikes midnight in Boston, the world outside remains swathed in the quiet embrace of overnight clouds. The air is crisp, a gentle nudge towards chill with temperatures slipping to the mid-thirties, accompanied by a light west wind that whispers through the night. This calm, however, gives way to the promise of dawn, where the day will unfold with a veil of parting clouds, allowing the sun to make its soft entrance. Tomorrow\u2019s experience will be defined by a pleasant mix of sun and lingering clouds, nudging temperatures to a cozy fifty-three degrees by afternoon.\n\nAmidst these tranquil conditions, the city beckons for simple pleasures. Consider donning a light jacket or a soft sweater to embrace the coolness of the morning, perfect for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River. The partly sunny afternoon invites visits to local caf\u00e9s, where the warmth of freshly brewed coffee can complement the emerging sun. It's an ideal moment for those seeking quiet corners to read, or perhaps a leisurely jog on the harborwalk, where the breeze carries the merest hint of spring. In these moments, with the city slowly awakening, one might catch the fragrant breath of blooming buds, marking the transition from winter\u2019s grasp toward brighter days ahead.",
