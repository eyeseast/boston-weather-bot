    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the atmosphere hangs heavy with the promise of rain, a backdrop for a day that balances the high energy of summer with the brewing tension of a storm. As the sun peeks through the scattered clouds and casts a warm glow, temperatures rise to nearly 96, though they will cool into the afternoon only slightly, offering a relentless embrace of humidity. The air thickens with heat index values that flirt with 102, painting the scene with a palpable warmth that speaks of activity both indoors and out, though caution is advised as the skies may rattle with ominous thunder and brilliant flashes of lightning.\n\nAs the sun surrenders to twilight, the opportunity for scattered storms continues until nightfall, a prelude to a cooler evening, dipping to around 68. Dressing in light, breathable fabrics will grant comfort during the day, with perhaps a light layer handy for later when the breeze whispers through the air. The evening calls for quieter pursuits\u2014perhaps a stroll through one of Boston\u2019s historic neighborhoods, where the architecture serves as a reminder of the past, or a leisurely read at a caf\u00e9 where the aroma of roasted coffee mingles with the rain-washed scent of the pavement. Keep an ear attuned to the distant rumbles of thunder, letting them be the soundtrack to a relaxed and contemplative evening.",
