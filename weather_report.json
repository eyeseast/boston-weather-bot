    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Boston, a hushed clarity envelops the city, with the air brisk and fresh, a herald of the calm weather promised for tomorrow. The stars peek through the chilly black canvas overhead, glimmering above a landscape of tranquil lights that twinkle like distant memories. The low temperatures cradle around seventeen degrees, urging those wandering the streets to bundle up against the cool embrace of December.\n\nLooking ahead, Sunday awaits with the promise of sunshine stretching its golden fingers across the cityscape, projecting a cheerful high of thirty-six degrees. A gentle northwest breeze will drift lazily by, creating an atmosphere that feels almost serene. This day suggests opportunities for unpretentious pleasures: a quiet stroll along the Charles, where the water reflects the vibrant hues of a winter sun, or perhaps a visit to an inviting caf\u00e9, where warmth and camaraderie chase away the chill. Dress warmly, but not overly so; a cozy scarf and a layered jacket will serve you well without hindering your movement. Embrace this moment in time, letting the simplicity of the day weave into the fabric of your life.",
