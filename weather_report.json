The sun casts a golden hue across the landscape, encouraging those who venture outside to savor the slight tug of summer lingering in the breeze. Though clouds dapple the sky like scattered thoughts, the sun still asserts itself, reaching a high around 82. A whisper of wind from the south adds a languid grace to the day, while the distinct possibility of showers and thunderstorms hovers like a soft promise, reminding us that even the brightest days can veer into unexpected territory.\n\nAs twilight approaches, the atmosphere shifts to a slight chill, inviting a touch of warmth as temperatures dip to around 61. Clouds carry the weight of possibility\u2014a slight chance for a drizzling shower or a brief rumble of thunder before nightfall. For the discerning wanderer, this transitional day calls for a layered approach; a light shirt under a comfortable jacket could provide that perfect balance against the cool evening that lies ahead. It\u2019s a fine time for a walk through the tree-lined streets, or perhaps a quiet moment at your favorite caf\u00e9, basking in the day\u2019s remaining glow. As the light begins to fade, consider an evening out\u2014perhaps a stroll along the harbor, where the reflections of the city dance in the water, unbothered by the chance of rain.",
