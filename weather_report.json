    "weather_report": "As the early hours of the morning grace Boston with a gentle calm, the air carries a tranquil coolness, settling around a low of fifty-seven degrees. The night sky, mostly clear, stretches into the horizon, lending an ethereal quality to the awakening city. A north wind, whispering at ten miles per hour, hints at the promise of a splendid day ahead. \n\nAs the sun prepares to rise, it will usher in a radiant Friday, one colored by clear skies and temperatures that will climb to a comfortable eighty degrees. The northeast wind will accompany this warmth, creating the perfect conditions for a day that invites leisurely strolls through the city's charming streets or perhaps a quiet moment spent in one of the lovely parks that dot the landscape. With this weather, a light, breathable attire will suit the mood perfectly; perhaps a linen shirt paired with comfortable shorts to allow the skin to bask in sunshine. As you venture out, consider taking a leisurely walk along the Charles River, where the water reflects the azure sky, or finding a cozy caf\u00e9 to sip a warm brew while people-watching as the city comes alive.",
