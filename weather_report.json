    "weather_report": "As dawn gently breaks over Boston, the city awakens under a clear sky, brushed with the soft hues of early light. Today, the sun promises to reign supreme, heralding a high temperature that flirts with the warmth of summer. With a confident southwest wind drifting through, the day carries a hint of promise in its breath, inviting residents to step outside and bask in the pleasant clarity that envelopes the urban landscape.\n\nAs evening approaches, a tapestry of clouds will begin to weave itself into the sky, offering a more subdued image, yet still leaving the day with a crispness that can invigorate. With temperatures dipping into a cool embrace, dressing in layers becomes imperative. A hearty sweater complemented by a stylish scarf will both protect against the chill and allow for a comfortable transition into the night. Given the day\u2019s inviting aura, a leisurely stroll through the neighborhood or a tranquil moment in one of Boston\u2019s parks would serve well to savor the beauty of the outdoors before the curtain of night falls, making way for a quieter scene.",
