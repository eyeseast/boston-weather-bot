    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Boston, a crisp stillness blankets the city, broken only by the whispering winds coursing through the streets. The air is sharp and invigorating, with temperatures dipping to around twelve degrees, while gusts flirt with the surety of the chill, reaching up to thirty-six miles per hour. Tonight appears mostly clear, laying bare a tapestry of stars that twinkle overhead, a refreshing contrast to the usual hustle and bustle. For those venturing outside, a well-insulated coat, perhaps layered over a warm sweater, gloves, and a sturdy hat would ward off the night\u2019s bite, transforming a simple stroll into a crisp adventure under the vast canopy of the universe.\n\nAs dawn approaches on Friday, the promise of a sunny day unfurls with the warmth of the early sun, which will nudge the mercury closer to twenty-four degrees. Yet, that alluring warmth will be tempered by wind chill values dropping to zero, reminding all that winter holds sway. It beckons, perhaps, a visit to the nearby parks where the clear skies invite a moment of tranquility; one might savor a hot beverage while watching the world pass by, taking in the fresh air that comes with a well-worn path. Dressing warmly and choosing outdoor activities, like a leisurely pop into a cozy caf\u00e9 or a thoughtful walk with a friend, will blend perfectly with the day\u2019s promise, finding comfort amid the chill and the lingering glow of the holiday spirit.",
