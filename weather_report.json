    "weather_report": "In the stillness of the early morning, Boston lies at the crossroads of night and day. The air carries a hint of warmth, a soft prelude to the heat that awaits. The sky is mostly clear, allowing for the sun to rise unobstructed, preparing to move swiftly toward a high that promises to steep the city in warmth, reaching nearly 98 degrees. The day ahead harbors faint echoes of humidity; a subtle reminder of the summer\u2019s lingering embrace and the heat index nudging closer to 103. \n\nAs the sun ascends, it will exchange the gentle whispers of the night for the spirited energy of a summer day. Dress lightly, perhaps in breathable fabrics that dance with the breeze, and remember to prepare for the sun\u2019s affection with a hat and ample hydration. The early hours beg for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or a quiet read in a shaded park before the full warmth of the day settles in. As the sun shimmers overhead, it invites both adventure and contemplation, beckoning you to relish in the vibrant pulse of the city, yet sparing moments for respite from its relentless glow.",
