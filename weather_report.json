    "weather_report": "As the evening wanes in Boston, a shroud of clouds blankets the city, hinting at the rain that will greet the dawn. The low temperature settles near 43 degrees, accompanied by a gentle northeast breeze that whispers through the streets, shifting the scent of impending moisture. A subtle chance of rain looms like an artist's brushstroke after 4 AM, painting the night sky in shades of gray and deepening the quiet that envelops the city.\n\nBy Thursday morning, a more pronounced drizzle will likely cascade from the heavens, accompanied by patchy fog that may render familiar sights into soft silhouettes. The high will inch towards 51, but the dampness in the air may make it feel cooler than it is. It\u2019s a day that invites layers\u2014an extra sweater, perhaps a waterproof jacket, and sturdy shoes to navigate the slick sidewalks. The heavy clouds above may seem dreary, yet there\u2019s a certain beauty in the way they cradle the city, producing moments ripe for cozy coffee breaks in intimate caf\u00e9s or leisurely strolls through fog-drenched parks. While outdoor activities might be dampened, this is a perfect day for embracing the city's indoor charms: perusing books in local bookstores, indulging in the warmth of freshly baked pastries, or simply enjoying a well-worn chair in your favorite nook as the rain dances lazily on the windows.",
