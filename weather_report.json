    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens its embrace over Boston, raindrops whisper against the pavement, giving voice to a passing shower. The air is tinged with a coolness that settles around you, the temperature barely nudging the low fifties. A westward wind cuts through the city, rustling the leaves and sending a brisk reminder of the lingering spring chill. As the night unfolds, the clouds loom heavily above, draping the skyline in a shroud of gray, yet they seem to pause, holding their breath before revealing any further secrets. \n\nTomorrow, the sun will emerge from behind this veil, casting a warm glow over a day that promises to be both bright and invigorating. With highs reaching near sixty-six, the contrast from tonight\u2019s dampness will feel refreshing and uplifting. A light jacket should suffice for the morning stroll, giving way to lighter attire as the day wears on. It may be a perfect time to explore the quieter corners of the city or perhaps settle into a cozy caf\u00e9 with a book in hand, allowing the gentle breeze to accompany your thoughts. This transitional moment serves as a gentle reminder that while the skies may be cloaked in clouds now, the promise of brightness and clarity lies just beyond the horizon.",
