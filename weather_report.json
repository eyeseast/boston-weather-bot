Currently, the city rests under a shroud of clouds, a soft blanket that hints at the possibility of showers later in the day. With temperatures rising to a comfortable warmth near 76, the sky will shift between moments of understated clarity and the gentle embrace of overcast. The southwest winds carry a mild whisper, urging one to step outside but to keep an umbrella close at hand.\n\nTonight, the atmosphere thickens with the certainty of rain showers that may evolve into thunderstorms, painting the late hours with the sound of heavy drops against windows and streets. As darkness drapes the city, the humidity will increase, nudging the temperature downward to a refreshing 58. In this ever-changing weather, light layers are advisable\u2014perhaps a light shirt accompanied by a fitted jacket for the evening chill and the dampness to come. Activities could embrace the cozy charm of an indoor caf\u00e9, where the aroma of coffee intertwines with the sound of raindrops, making for a serene retreat during the brewing storm.",
