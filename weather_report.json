    "weather_report": "As the night envelops Boston, the air holds a crispness that hints at winter's approach. The temperature dips toward thirty-four, where a gentle west wind stirs quietly through the streets. The glow of city lights punctuates the dark, casting a soft, serene ambiance over the landscape. Expect a touch of rain to arrive come afternoon tomorrow, creeping in after three o'clock when the sun, perhaps shyly, will attempt to shine through the clouds, warming the day to about forty-seven. With a fifty percent chance of precipitation, it\u2019s wise to carry an umbrella, though the drizzle may only be a fleeting whisper.\n\nTonight beckons for layers. A warm sweater under a coat, perhaps accompanied by a well-loved scarf, will stand you in good stead against the chill. While outdoor activities may call\u2014perhaps a stroll along the Charles, or an evening spent sipping a hot beverage at your favorite caf\u00e9\u2014the weather suggests moments of warmth and coziness indoors may soon become necessary. Tomorrow's conditions invite a mix of sun and rain; the day presents itself as a canvas of muted colors, a reflection of the season. So whether you're taking a leisurely walk or indulging in a good book by the fire, embrace the quiet beauty that winter brings to this historic city.",
