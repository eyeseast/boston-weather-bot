    "weather_report": "As the night wears on in Boston, a quilt of clouds drapes over the city, offering a glimpse of the delicate interplay between urban illumination and the obscuring veil of sky. The temperature gently falls to around 51 degrees, a soft reminder that a chill lingers in the air, particularly with the northwest winds brushing through at a brisk 17 mph. While there is only a slight chance of rain before dawn, the atmosphere is charged with anticipation, hinting at the showers that may creep in as the day unfolds.\n\nLooking toward Monday, the clouds will persist, casting a muted light over the city and inviting a sense of introspection. Isolated rain showers are possible after the sun makes its tentative ascent. Residents may feel the soft patter of rain against their umbrellas or jackets, bringing the scent of fresh earth to the mix. For today, a long-sleeved shirt paired with a light coat would be wise attire, as cool winds may nip at exposed skin. The forecast hints at an overall high of around 61; thus, comfort lies not in warmth but in practicality. This time of year beckons for quieter pursuits, perhaps a leisurely stroll through a local cafe or a visit to the green spaces, where nature awakens in gentle bursts. As Boston unravels its secrets this Monday, find solace in the muted hues of the day and embrace its quiet unfolding.",
