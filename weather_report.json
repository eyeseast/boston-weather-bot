    "weather_report": "As the night cloaks Boston in a damp embrace, the sky weeps softly, bringing forth a persistent rain that has settled upon the city. The chill in the air, lingering just above freezing, pairs with northeast winds gusting like whispers, weaving through the streets and alleys, creating a symphony of sound that sings of a long, somber drive toward dawn. The persistent clatter of raindrops against windows provides a gentle reminder to find warmth indoors, as visibility is shrouded and clarity obscured by the veil of precipitation.\n\nLooking ahead, the day unfolds in a similar manner: an unremitting drizzle will dance, drifting between rain and light snow while fog creeps into the corners of your vision, lending a weight to the atmosphere. With temperatures hovering in the low thirties, one should don attire that promotes resilience\u2014a sturdy raincoat, woolen layers, and waterproof footwear will serve you well while traversing this watery landscape. The city may not radiate warmth outside, but the coziness of home invites reading, writing, or sipping tea as you listen to the rain\u2019s lullaby. An afternoon nestled indoors could be spent indulging in the comfort of a recommended book or simply watching the world blur softly beyond fogged windows, letting nature\u2019s show morph into a moment of reflection.",
