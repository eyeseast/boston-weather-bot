    "weather_report": "This morning in Boston greets you with a muted palette, the remnants of a light snowfall whispering through the gray veil of mostly cloudy skies. As the chill lingers in the air, a stubborn wind brushes past, reminding you to bundle up lest the cold fingers of January tighten their grip. The high of just 31 may speak to the season, but the low promise of 11 tonight underscores the urgency for warmth. There\u2019s a 40 percent chance of snow has left a lovely patina of moisture in the air, although clarity is eclipsed by the haze of fog that clings to the corners of the city, blurring the outlines of its tall buildings and the famed waterfront.\n\nThrough this weather, Boston beckons with the comfort of cafes where the scent of brewing coffee mingles with the muffled conversations of early risers. Layering with a coat, perhaps even a scarf, would be prudent for today\u2019s ventures. A stroll through a local market or perhaps a visit to the Boston Public Library, where warm interiors invite you to linger over a good book, would suit the contemplative tone of the day. Pack your gloves and retain the spirit of exploration; even amid the gray, Boston\u2019s heart beats with stories waiting to be uncovered.",
