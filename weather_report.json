    "weather_report": "As the clock ticks into the early hours in Boston, a blanket of clouds drapes over the city, casting a muted veil across the skyline. The air is crisp, carrying a cool touch reminiscent of the first days of spring, with temperatures dipping around 46 degrees and a persistent northwest wind stirring the atmosphere with a gentle but firm embrace. The gusts may rise up to 29 mph, adding a brisk edge to the night as the city breathes in a tranquil calm.\n\nAs dawn approaches, a cloudy Tuesday morning gives way to a high near 59, rendering the day a quintessentially cool spring endeavor. Light breezes will continue to caress the streets, inviting layered dressing\u2014perhaps a comfortable sweater wrapped in a longer coat that shields against the chill. The low light will keep the charm of early morning exploration alive, beckoning you towards a quiet local caf\u00e9 or an unhurried stroll along the Charles River. With the absence of sun, vibrant colors may feel subdued, but this is the perfect backdrop for reflection or for gathering with friends inside cozy bistros adorned with the warmth of shared laughter. As the day unfolds, Boston will flourish under its cloudy canopy, a reminder that even the gray skies allow for moments of beauty in simplicity.",
