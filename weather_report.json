    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Boston, a quilt of clouds lingers in the sky, casting a muted glow upon the city. The chill of the night settles in, with winds audibly whispering through the streets, carrying a briskness that hints at the rawness of winter soon to loosen its grip. Tonight, temperatures are expected to dip into the low twenties, making it a good time to reach for that heavier coat or a snug scarf to wrap around your neck. With gusts that dance between sixteen and twenty-three miles per hour, a sturdy hat may prevent the playful winds from sweeping away your warmth.\n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, the sun will reclaim the stage, promising a brilliant expanse of blue. The high will wander up to a modest forty-one, bringing with it a shining optimism that invites you to explore. Dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater beneath your coat\u2014as you take a stroll through the serenity of a sunlit park, where the early light glistens on the frosted grass. Or, if you fancy respite from the cool air, consider finding solace in a cozy cafe, where the aroma of rich coffee provides a perfect counterpoint to the brisk day. Either choice embraces the beauty of a February day, unapologetically alive and waiting for you to step into its embrace.",
