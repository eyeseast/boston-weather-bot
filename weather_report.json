    "weather_report": "As night blankets Boston, a cloister of clouds cradles the city, veiling the streets and buildings in a gentle shroud of murky gray. The air carries a hint of moisture, whispering of impending rain showers that may greet you before the clock strikes midnight. With a slight chill settling in, it feels as if the wind itself is a tad bit unruly, rustling through the alleys and down the avenues with gusts that could steal a breath. For those wandering out tonight, a coat offering some insulation from the coolness will be necessary, perhaps complemented by a scarf to fend off the creeping chill.\n\nAs the dawn approaches, tomorrow retains the promise of muted skies with just a fleeting chance of rain in the late afternoon. The day is destined to unfold beneath a mostly cloudy canopy, with a high that nudges at the seasonal chill, draping itself over the usual bustle of the city. Practicality reigns in wardrobe choices; layers will keep comfort from slipping away, striking a balance between warmth and ease. Whether wandering through a local caf\u00e9, savoring the rich aroma of a fresh brew, or taking a leisurely stroll along the banks of the Charles, Boston offers a moody charm that invites you to embrace the day steadily, in a spirit of quiet exploration\u2014exactly as winter calls for.",
