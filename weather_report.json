    "weather_report": "As night settles over Boston, a blanket of clouds envelops the city, casting a tranquil yet somber hue upon the landscape. The temperature dips to a crisp 34 degrees, and a gentle breeze from the west carries a touch of winter's chill. Tomorrow beckons with a forecast of mixed rain and snow, the scene poised for a gradual unfolding of wintry precipitation from late afternoon. With temperatures rising to a modest 41, the atmosphere will likely feel damp and uninviting, encouraging a cozy retreat into the comforts of home, perhaps with a warm drink in hand.\n\nFor those venturing out, a pragmatic approach is in order: layers of warmth are essential alongside a sturdy raincoat to weather the impending mix. While the skies may not inspire long strolls beneath the heavens, the calls of nearby cafes and bookstores offer a welcome diversion. One might find solace in the pages of a good book or the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, while watching the world through rain-speckled windows. The day promises an understated intimacy, a reminder that even when the weather turns gray and blustery, the heart can find refuge in the simplest of pleasures.",
