    "weather_report": "Tonight in Boston, a soft murmur of rain falls, mingling with a touch of unobtrusive fog that quietly envelops the evening. The air carries a crisp chill, reminiscent of an autumn's retreat, as temperatures dip to a low of about 35 degrees. A gentle southwest wind whispers through the streets, stirring leaves and minds alike, making it wise to wrap oneself in layers and perhaps don a hat to brush away the nips of cold and moisture. \n\nLooking ahead to the morrow, Boston will emerge into a realm of sunlight, albeit fleeting, as the high reaches up to 41 degrees before the afternoon settles into a cooler embrace around 35. A westerly breeze will accompany the day, lively at times, beckoning residents to appreciate the glow of the sun while it lasts. One might venture outside to explore the quieter charms of the city, perhaps indulging in a stroll through lush, empty parks or enjoying a hot beverage from a local caf\u00e9, in cozy layers that balance warmth with comfort. It\u2019s a day that invites attention to the gentle transitions of nature while encouraging quiet moments amid the bustling life of Boston.",
