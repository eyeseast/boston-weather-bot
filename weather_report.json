    "weather_report": "As Boston settles into the cool embrace of night, the sky hangs heavy with clouds, casting a muted glow over the city\u2019s illuminated streets. The temperature drapes around 35 degrees, a precise chill that seeps in, nudging residents to wrap themselves in layers of warmth. A gentle west wind whispers at around 9 mph, adding a crispness that reminds us winter is now upon us. This evening\u2019s ambiance feels contemplative, a time for quiet reflection as the pulse of the city slows. \n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the sun will stretch its arms to pierce the cloud cover, promising a bright beginning to the week. Expect the high to reach about 41, followed by a graceful descent to the mid-30s as afternoon rolls in. The west winds will dance a bit more energetically, gusting up to 23 mph, invigorating the air around us. It may be an opportune time to adorn yourself in warm layers\u2014think of cozy sweaters paired with scarves that can fend off the chill if you find yourself outdoors. The day beckons for long strolls through forgotten neighborhoods or perhaps a visit to a charming caf\u00e9, where the warmth of coffee can wrap around your senses like an old friend. Tomorrow may not boast clear skies, but it holds the promise of sunshine and stirring moments in this beautiful, resilient city.",
