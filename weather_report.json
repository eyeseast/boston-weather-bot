    "weather_report": "In Boston today, a thick blanket of clouds lingers above, creating a muted canvas against which the city\u2019s architecture stands boldly yet somberly. The wind sweeps through with a bracing vigor, rustling the trees and adding a brisk chill that reminds us that spring is still finding its footing. Though the temperature hovers around the low fiftys, it feels cooler against the skin, particularly when gusts whip up to remind us of the lingering grip of winter. As evening approaches, the promise of a partly cloudy sky beckons, offering a brief respite from the morning's gloom, yet the warmth of the day will not fully settle into the evening\u2019s embrace.\n\nFor those venturing outside, the attire should be practical and layered\u2014a light jacket or sweater to fend off the wind would feel comforting against the cool air. Perhaps a stroll along the Charles River, with a thermos of warm coffee in hand, would be ideal, allowing for moments of quiet observation of the industrious city. Alternatively, exploring one of the local caf\u00e9s may provide a cozy retreat from the wind, where one can indulge in a good book or enjoy the gentle chatter of fellow patrons. This afternoon may lack the vibrancy of sunny skies, but it possesses an understated charm that invites a slower pace, urging you to engage with the rhythm of a not-so-far-away summer.",
