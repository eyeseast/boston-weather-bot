    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, the city is cloaked in a gentle veil of rain and patchy fog, the air heavy with the anticipation of spring's often capricious embrace. The temperature hovers in the low thirties, a chill that nudges you towards the warmth of a well-chosen coat, perhaps layered with a soft sweater beneath. The rain, though light, is persistent, tapping softly against windows and sidewalks, while the east wind whispers secrets through the branches of awakening trees, inviting a brisk walk alongside the esplanade or a cozy morning spent indoors with a book and a cup of tea.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the steady shroud of moisture lingers, although the fog will gradually retreat, giving way to a cloudy landscape. With a high nearing forty-five, the midday hours may beckon you out for a stroll or a visit to a local caf\u00e9. Dressed comfortably with an umbrella in hand and perhaps a scarf wrapped snugly around your neck, you might find comfort in the muted vibrancy of a day that feels both contemplative and serene. Whether you opt for the solace of indoor pursuits or venture into the softness of the damp air, today invites you to embrace a quiet kind of beauty that Boston wears so well amidst the shifting seasons.",
