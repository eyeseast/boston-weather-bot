    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of the night, Boston rests beneath a shroud of scattered clouds, their dark outlines softened by the gentle apricot glow of distant city lights. The air is cool, a welcoming embrace at around 51 degrees, encouraging a light jacket or perhaps a cozy sweater for those brave enough to step outside. As the morning unfolds, the sun will rise triumphantly, casting warm beams across the cityscape, promising a delightful day ahead. In the embrace of sunny skies, temperatures are poised to reach a pleasant 79 degrees, soothing the spirit as the soft winds whisper through the trees.\n\nPicture yourself wandering down the cobblestone streets, perhaps indulging in a leisurely coffee at a local caf\u00e9, where the sweet scent of freshly brewed espresso mingles with the chatter of morning conversations. The day calls for light, breathable clothing\u2014perhaps a simple shirt and comfortable pants, paired with footwear suited for the vibrant streets that beckon for exploration. With such splendid weather, one might even find a moment to stroll along the Charles River, relish the gentle rustle of leaves, and take in the symphony of nature awakening around you. It is a fitting day to savor the little pleasures, to connect with the energy of the city, and to embrace the warmth of day as it unfolds.",
