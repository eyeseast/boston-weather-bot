    "weather_report": "As the midnight hour settles over Boston, a tranquil calm blankets the city, with only the gentle whispers of a weekend breeze teasing the night air. The forecast hints at a promising Independence Day, a sun-drenched canvas waiting to be painted with the vibrant hues of fireworks and celebrations. With a refreshing low lingering near 64 degrees, the warmth of summer is feeling just right, a soft invitation to step out under the stars.\n\nTomorrow's sunlight will drench the city in its embrace, as temperatures rise to a genteel 82 degrees, pushed along by a light northwest wind that beckons one outside. This is a day meant for leisure; ideal for enjoying a leisurely stroll along the Charles or perhaps setting up a picnic in the shade of Boston Common. A sun hat and lightweight clothing will serve you well, as the sun climbs higher, ready to weave the fabric of fun and togetherness. Consider revealing yet comfortable attire, perhaps a breezy shirt paired with those favorite shorts, all complemented by a moderate pair of footwear for the day's jaunts. Embrace the simplicity of this day; relish in the moments shared with friends or family, and wouldn't it be just lovely to catch a local band play or wander through the stalls of a farmer's market? \n\nIn these fleeting hours before dawn, allow the promise of the day ahead to nestle in your thoughts, providing just enough inspiration to dream of a sparkling afternoon filled with laughter and joy.",
