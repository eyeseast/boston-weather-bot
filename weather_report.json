The air holds a subtle promise of rain\u2014just a whisper of moisture lingering on the skin amid the cloud-laden midnight sky. Tonight\u2019s low settles around a comfortable 62 degrees, with a soft breeze whispering from the south, creating an ambiance that feels both inviting and a little mysterious.\n\nLooking toward Sunday, a slight chance of early morning showers may greet the dawn, but by midday the clouds will part to reveal glimpses of the sun, offering a balmy high near 82 degrees. With a southwest wind lifting the spirits of the day, it hints at a perfect opportunity for a leisurely stroll through the park, perhaps with a steaming cup of coffee in hand. As the sun breaks through the clouds, it calls for light layers, leaving behind the heavier attire of earlier. Embrace the warmth with a casual shirt and comfortable trousers, making the most of this day where the weather dances between serene and exuberant.",
