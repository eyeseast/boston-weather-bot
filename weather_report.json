    "weather_report": "The quiet of the early morning in Boston wraps the city in a blanket of patchy fog, softening the edges of familiar landmarks and dampening the sounds of the waking world. A gentle north wind stirs lazily, whispering promises of a clearing sky that lies just beyond the haze. As the day unfolds, the fog will dissipate, revealing a canvas of mostly sunny skies where the sun will climb and warm the air to a manageable 72 degrees. The gentleness of a northeast breeze will be refreshing, inviting you to step outside and bask in the transition of the season.\n\nAs the day brightens, consider slipping into comfortable attire\u2014perhaps a light sweater or a breezy shirt, paired with fitted trousers or relaxed jeans. The ambiance is ripe for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River or a visit to one of Boston's charming cafes, where the warmth of the sun can be enjoyed in tandem with a good book or warm coffee. Alternatively, the day beckons you to appreciate the serene beauty of nature, perhaps with a visit to Franklin Park, where the trees stand sentinel and the sounds of rustling leaves are a gentle reminder of the changing season.",
