    "weather_report": "This afternoon, Boston greets its inhabitants with a radiant sun, casting a gentle warmth that brings comfort to the spirit. The day unfolds with a crispness that hints at the autumnal transition, inviting folks to step outside as a light breeze stirs the leaves. The temperature hovers around a pleasant sixty-four degrees, making it a delightful afternoon to stroll along the Charles River or visit a nearby caf\u00e9, sipping on a warm beverage while soaking in the vibrant hues of fall. The sky's clarity stands robustly, unmarred by clouds, inviting reflection on how generous nature can be at this time of year.\n\nAs evening approaches, however, a shift looms on the horizon. Rain showers are expected to weave through the night, bringing with them a 60% chance of soaking the streets in a gentle embrace of moisture. It\u2019s wise to prepare for this change; a light jacket might do in the earlier hours, but an umbrella will soon become a necessary companion. For those considering the evening, perhaps a quiet night in with a good book or a playful board game with friends would suffice, rather than braving the elements. The cozy atmosphere ahead, with patchy fog likely dancing through the air, creates an evening ripe for introspection and warmth.",
