    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Boston, a gentle yet persistent rain taps against windows, drenching the city in a blanket of darkness. The air holds a cool embrace, tempered by a southwest wind that carries a brisk chill through the streets, a reminder that autumn is at its zenith. Looking ahead to Veterans Day tomorrow, hope glimmers with the promise of a reprieve as the rain subsides, giving way to a mostly sunny spell. Although temperatures will hover around a comfortable 66 degrees in the morning, expect a gradual descent, leaving the late afternoon feeling a touch cooler, near 60. The potential for sunshine whispers of clarity and a chance to breathe in the fresh, crisp air.\n\nFor those venturing out, layers will be your ally; a light jacket may guard against the remnants of this evening\u2019s rain while allowing for a comfortable transition into the sunnier hours. Consider choosing a softer, earth-toned ensemble to match the moody atmosphere of the evening. With weather that leans towards the delightful in daylight, a leisurely stroll through evolving autumn leaves or a visit to a local cafe may beckon you. As the clock ticks closer to an end to the rain, the city prepares to awaken once more, inviting exploration amid both reflection and the gentle rhythms of life.",
