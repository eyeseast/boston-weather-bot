    "weather_report": "As the night drapes its velvety cloak over Boston, a quiet calm envelops the city. The air is crisp, carrying a hint of coolness that whispers deeply of spring. Tonight, the stars twinkle faintly above like secrets shared among friends, and the temperature dips gently to a cozy 48 degrees. A soft breeze from the west stirs the leaves, inviting an easy peace, while city lights twinkle below, casting a warm glow against the darkness.\n\nCome morning, Boston will awaken to a bright sun painting the sky in hues of blue and warmth. The forecast promises a cheerful day of sunshine, with a high reaching near 67 degrees. A northwest wind will weave through the streets, playfully swirling leaves and lifting spirits, with gusts that might startle but ultimately invigorate. This promises to be not only a pleasant Sunday but a perfect opportunity to break away from indoor confines. Dress comfortably, perhaps in layers\u2014a light jacket for the morning chill that gives way to the reassuring embrace of a sun-kissed afternoon. \n\nYou might wander along the Charles River, where the light dances across the water, or meander through one of the city\u2019s inviting parks, where laughter mingles with the rustle of grass underfoot. A leisurely stroll could very well lead to a hidden caf\u00e9, the perfect spot to sip a warm beverage, catching up with a friend amidst the gentle hum of weekend chatter.",
