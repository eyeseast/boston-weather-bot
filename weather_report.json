    "weather_report": "As the dawn breaks over Boston, the atmosphere is muted, wrapped in a veil of patchy fog that dances lightly across the landscape. Today begins with an air of anticipation, hinting at the possibility of rain that might wash the city clean while softening edges and contours. The high is expected to hug the cool side of fifty degrees, with a west wind whispering through the streets, making it feel like an early glimpse of spring, albeit draped in seasonal uncertainty. There\u2019s a distinct chance of rain showers that could linger into the morning, and a sense of quiet prevails as the city stirs awake, the fog blurring the usual vibrancy of its outlines.\n\nAs daylight unfurls, it\u2019s best to wrap oneself in layers\u2014perhaps a sturdy jacket and a light scarf to ward off the chill, tempered by a hint of dampness in the air. This might be a perfect day for leisurely indoor pursuits that allow for graceful retreat from the unpredictable weather\u2014perhaps exploring a local caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink while gazing out at the shifting scenery, or even getting lost in one of Boston's many museums, where the world feels both contained and expansive. As evening draws near, the low will settle around thirty-four, so a cozy evening indoors might just be the remedy for the weather outside, inviting a sense of warmth and comfort as the fog deepens and the rain makes its quiet return.",
