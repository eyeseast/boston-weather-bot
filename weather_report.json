    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Boston, a gentle calm envelops the city. The air, cool and crisp, carries a whisper of warmth from a day well spent. Tonight, the sky reveals its vast canvas with mostly clear conditions, ideal for stargazing or a leisurely stroll through empty streets that echo with the day's fading energy. With temperatures settling around a comfortable 52 degrees, a light jacket or a cozy sweater would be the perfect companion for any evening adventure, whether it\u2019s a quiet moment on your balcony or a late dinner in the comforting glow of a favorite caf\u00e9.\n\nTomorrow greets us with promises of sunshine and delightful warmth as the sun rises to usher in a high near 75 degrees. The soft caress of a southwest breeze will accompany the golden rays, inviting all to step outside and embrace the beauty of the day. Perhaps a visit to a local market, where fresh produce calls you to wander, or an afternoon in one of Boston's storied parks would be in order. As the hours unfold, the allure of the outdoors will be hard to resist, making every moment spent beneath the clear blue sky a treasure.",
