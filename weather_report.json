    "weather_report": "As night gently drapes over Boston, the streets begin to breathe a sigh, cloaked in a veil of hazy clouds and the quiet warmth of early spring. The air is cool, dipping to the low thirties, and although the gentle north wind barely stirs, the night carries the promise of change. Tomorrow holds whispers of rain, lingering in the daylight\u2019s embrace, where the sun may poke through the clouds, mingling with the uncertainty of scattered showers in the afternoon.\n\nIn this unpredictable transition, it\u2019s wise to dress in layers\u2014perhaps a soft sweater beneath a light jacket, paired with comfortable trousers, honoring both the mild chill and potential drizzles. As the aromatic scent of coffee wafts through the air, consider an evening stroll among the shimmering reflections on the Charles, or perhaps a cozy visit to a local caf\u00e9. It\u2019s an ideal time to embrace the transition of seasons, a moment to savor the soft sounds of the city in repose, relishing the calm before the storm.",
