    "weather_report": "As we settle into the afternoon in Boston, a shroud of patchy smoke lingers in the air, casting a muted glow over the vibrant streets. The sun\u2019s warm embrace is palpable, hinting at a high near 90, yet the visibility is less than pristine, creating an atmospheric canvas that blurs the sharp lines of the horizon. The gentle east wind carries an inviting whisper, but the haze conjures an air of introspection, inviting contemplative strolls rather than boisterous outdoor gatherings.\n\nAs the evening approaches, expect transition into partly cloudy skies, wrapping the bustling city in a soft blanket of warmth. The temperature will dip to a comfortable low around 65, perfect for a leisurely evening walk or perhaps a quiet dinner at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, where the sounds of the city blend seamlessly with delightful conversation. Dressing in light layers will ensure comfort\u2014enough to shield against the cool night air without sacrificing the ease of the day\u2019s warmth. As dusk falls, it\u2019s an ideal moment for enjoying a book in a tranquil park or savoring a chilled drink on a patio, allowing the day to wrap up gently amid the lingering smokiness that gives Boston its own kind of charm.",
