    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds over Boston, the city finds itself cloaked in the somber embrace of overcast skies. The air carries with it the unmistakable hint of rain, as droplets tease the horizon, poised to cascade down between four and five o'clock. A chill lingers, with temperatures hovering around forty-four degrees, while the south wind whispers through the streets, urging citizens to consider the warmth of layered clothing. With an eighty percent chance of precipitation, the time has come to reach for umbrellas, perhaps even those worn with the slight battle scars of the past.\n\nAs dusk begins to set in, the forecast foretells a continuing dance with rain and an eerie patchiness of fog that could weave into the night. By seven o'clock, the city may experience a flirtation with freezing rain, while the low dips to thirty-two degrees. Given these conditions, it would be wise to don water-resistant footwear and a cozy coat, perhaps complemented by a scarf to shield against the dampness. For those seeking solace from the chill, a quiet afternoon spent tucked away in a caf\u00e9 with a warm beverage would fit the bill\u2014perfect for watching the world gently blur through the rain-streaked window. Alternatively, one may meander along the quieter streets, feeling the ephemeral nature of the day's three o'clock light gradually surrender to the encroaching gloom.",
