    "weather_report": "The night envelops Boston in a thick, damp embrace, with rain steadily cascading down, a relentless percussion that underscores the stillness of the moment. The air is laden with the earthy scent of soaked asphalt, a natural balm on an unyieldingly clouded sky. As the clock ticks toward dawn, the warmth of the evening lingers, a modest 55 degrees, but the gusty winds whisper unsettling tales, streaking southward at nearly 17 mph. As you peer into the darkness, visibility dwindles, creating an atmosphere perfect for introspection or perhaps an unhurried cup of tea, accompanied by the gentle patter of raindrops against the window.\n\nAs you awaken to Monday, the rain offers no reprieve; it will continue to weave its tale throughout the day, veiling the morning in gray. Expect the high to inhabit the upper fifties, accompanied by winds that carry a hint of chill along with their strength. Dressing for a day like this calls for layers \u2014 a light rain jacket or a cozy sweater will serve well against both the chill of the breeze and the persistent drizzle. A venture outdoors may require a particular attitude \u2014 perhaps take a slow stroll under an umbrella or find comfort in a favorite caf\u00e9, where the rhythm of rain can be experienced from the warm embrace of indoors. These mundane choices can transform a dreary day into a canvas for quiet enjoyment.",
