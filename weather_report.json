    "weather_report": "This morning, Boston awakens under a gentle embrace of warmth, the sun casting a soft glow that hints at the beauty of the day ahead. The air is crisp yet inviting, making it a fine opportunity for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River, where the water glimmers in tandem with the sky. As the hours drift closer to midday, temperatures are set to rise, nudging playfully toward a comfortable 62 degrees. The winds whisper softly from the southeast, barely rustling the budding leaves.\n\nHowever, as evening approaches, the serene tiding of the day will yield to a more elusive character. Rain showers are anticipated to unfurl their misty tendrils between midnight and dawn, carrying with them the promise of patchy fog that may linger in the corners of the city, cloaking the streets in a gauzy veil. As the temperature dips toward a cooler 47, the gentle embrace of a light jacket may be in order; perhaps even a forgiving scarf to ward off the evening chill. For those with their hearts set on evening outings, seeking refuge in a cozy caf\u00e9 with a warm drink and a good book might be the best way to ride out the anticipated rain, enjoying the simple pleasures of urban life as the world outside transforms under a curtain of refreshing droplets.",
