    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, a veil of clouds holds dominion, shrouding the city in a soft grayness. The air is thick with the promise of rain, the moisture hanging palpably, portending the arrival of sporadic showers that will grace the morning hours. By mid-morning, expect a gentle but persistent patter to accompany you as you navigate through your day, with the potential for patchy fog adding a touch of mystery to the brisk atmosphere. The temperature hovers in the low fifties, encouraging you to don a warm coat, perhaps accompanied by a scarf to fend off the cool southeast breeze that whispers through the streets.\n\nAs daylight wanes into the evening, a transition is in store, bringing clarity and calm as the clouds disperse to unveil a mostly clear sky. The chill will deepen, making a cozy evening indoors with a warm beverage a splendid choice. Tonight, the temperatures will dip into the thirties, creating an embrace of warmth necessary for your well-deserved respite after a day of muted encounters with the elements. Consider wrapping up in a soft sweater or snuggling up with a good book, allowing the hustle of the day to melt away as the crisp night envelops you.",
