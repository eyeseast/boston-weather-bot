    "weather_report": "As the dark hours of the night retreat, Boston stands watch under a cloak of clouds. There\u2019s a sense of stillness in the air, yet the hint of moisture lingers, signaling a chance of rain\u2014a precursor to a playful mix of rain and snow. The temperature feels crisp, nipping at exposed skin, while the winds generate an occasional rustle, whispering tales of the warmth that awaits in the rising hours. With clouds thickening overhead, visibility may feel somewhat muted, casting a gentle shroud over the city's vibrant lights.\n\nAs dawn unfurls, Boston will awaken to a more cheerful disposition. The sky promises to clear as the day matures, revealing a canvas of blue punctuated by the warmth of the sun, casting shadows upon the streets below. By midday, expect a mildness that invites layers but does not demand heavy attire. A fitted sweater or a light jacket would harmonize with the soft southern winds, allowing for both comfort and ease. The day\u2019s gentler qualities create an ideal backdrop for leisurely strolls through the city's historic neighborhoods or perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9, where one might curl up with a good book and a warm cup in hand, savoring the simple joys of a winter\u2019s day.",
