    "weather_report": "As the sun lingers in its afternoon ascent over Boston, the warmth wraps the city in a gentle embrace, a promise of a vibrant summer day. With a peak temperature wavering near 93, there's a faint hint of humidity playing at the edges, yet the air remains predominantly clear, allowing an unobstructed view of the distant skyline. The wispy clouds drifting lazily through the azure canvas give a touch of whimsy to the scene, while a light easterly breeze whispers of the refreshing promise of evening. There\u2019s a chance of brief showers or thunderstorms, but for now, the skies offer more sunshine than uncertainty.\n\nAs twilight approaches, you may want to shed your heavy layers, opting instead for breathable fabrics and light colors to keep cool. However, as night creeps in, a soft sweater may prove a wise companion, with temperatures gently dipping to a comfortable 66. Tonight's gentle embrace of clouds means that if you venture outdoors, perhaps a stroll along the riverfront or a quiet evening in the park could serve as a delightful remedy to the day\u2019s warmth. With the city bathed in the golden hues of sunset, the atmosphere is simply inviting.",
