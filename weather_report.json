    "weather_report": "In Boston, as dawn breaks over the horizon, the day unfolds under a heavy, brooding sky, casting a muted gray hue over the city. The air hangs with an uneasy promise of precipitation, and as the morning progresses, there\u2019s a subtle chill that seeps through layers of clothing, urging you to reach for a warm scarf or a robust coat. As we move into the afternoon, the temperature hovers around a brisk 34 degrees, teasing a slight chance of freezing rain after 5 PM. The wind whispers through the trees, a gentle northward breath that feels almost haunting in its quietness.\n\nAs night approaches, the atmosphere thickens with the likelihood of both rain and freezing rain, creating a tapestry of dampness that envelops the streets. The evening\u2019s low dips to a chilly 32 degrees, and the chance of precipitation surges upwards, inviting you to seek refuge indoors, perhaps drawing closer to a steaming mug of tea or a cozy blanket. It\u2019s a day best enjoyed under the shelter of your home or in the warmth of a caf\u00e9, watching life drift by as the urban landscape reveals its beauty in a soft, muted palette. Given the weather's delicate nature, it\u2019s wise to dress in layers that can withstand the dampness while keeping you snug, allowing for small adventures by day and the comfort of home by night.",
