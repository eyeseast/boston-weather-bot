    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Boston, the air is tinged with the promise of winter\u2019s embrace. Raindrops dance softly against the window, mingling with flurries of snow, draping the city in a chilly veil. With the temperature dipping into the mid-twenties and a gentle north wind whispering through the streets, the atmosphere holds a hushed anticipation. It\u2019s a night where one might savor the warmth of a cozy blanket, the flicker of candlelight, and perhaps a good book, as nature wraps itself in soft precipitation.\n\nAs dawn breaks tomorrow, the snow is expected to linger like a delicate reminder of winter's presence. Before noon, a few flurries may flirt with the clouds, but the day promises to remain overcast and brisk. A high near 29 invites layers\u2014think knitted scarves and woolen hats to fend off the chill. As you step outside, consider a leisurely stroll through the quiet streets, where the charm of the snowfall creates a serene backdrop for quiet reflection, or indulge in a warming cup of coffee from a local caf\u00e9, soaking in the gentle hum of conversation. Whether you seek solitude or the company of friends, this day beckons with the simple joys that can only be found when the world is wrapped in a snowy embrace.",
