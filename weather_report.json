    "weather_report": "As dawn unfurls over Boston, the city awakens under a veil of subtle mist, remnants of patchy fog lingering in the chill of early morning. The day teeters between clarity and obscurity, with fragile beams of sunlight attempting to pierce through the muted overcast sky. A slight chance of snow flits about, teasing the air but likely to fade as the day progresses. The temperature, huddled around a brisk 27 degrees, nudges Boston toward a wintry charm, albeit with a twinge of discomfort from the biting north wind that meanders through the streets.\n\nAs the evening approaches, the weather promises to settle into a clearer sky, guiding the wind to quiet down to a gentle whisper. For those braving the day ahead, layering becomes essential; a thick scarf to ward off the cold and a warm jacket would keep the chill at bay while one navigates the city\u2019s quiet corners. Perhaps it\u2019s a good time for a stroll along the esplanade, where the glimmers of the Charles River reflect the fleeting sunlight, or a warm cup of coffee at a snug caf\u00e9 can provide a welcome invitation to pause and enjoy the moment. Boston\u2019s spirit may feel muted today, but the allure of its beauty remains steadfast beneath the frosty exterior.",
