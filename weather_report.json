    "weather_report": "The morning in Boston unfolds beneath a canvas of shifting clouds, hinting at the intricacies of a winter day. A gentle breeze stirs, carrying the crisp chill characteristic of this season, while the sun plays a subtle game of hide and seek between patches of gray and blue. Currently, the air hangs at just around 40 degrees, perhaps feeling brisker as it dips into the mid-thirties later on. Today holds the potential for a fleeting shower around midday, but such is the nature of these winter months\u2014a whisper of moisture amidst a predominantly dry atmosphere.\n\nAs evening approaches, it promises to cloak the city in a veil of clouds, with temperatures sinking to a frosty 25 degrees. When venturing outdoors, warmth will be your ally; layering is advised\u2014think a robust coat over a soft sweater, complemented by a snug hat and gloves. For those looking to embrace the day, a leisurely stroll through the park or a quaint caf\u00e9 visit to enjoy something warm and comforting could be the perfect antidote to the chilly air. Perhaps a stop by a local bookstore, where the scent of coffee mingles with the pages of new adventures, would also gracefully punctuate the closing hours of the day.",
