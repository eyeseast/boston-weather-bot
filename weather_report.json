    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Boston, a gentle heaviness lingers in the air, hinting at the rain that will soon grace the city. The clouds, fat with moisture, obscure the last glimpses of daylight, rendering the horizon a muted canvas of gray. With a temperature that hovers around a comforting 58 degrees, the evening invites a certain coziness that begs for the embrace of a lightweight sweater or a soft jacket. \n\nTomorrow promises a shift, as the clouds begin to part, allowing slivers of sun to peek through and usher in a high near 69. A soft breeze from the northeast will toy with the leaves and add a delightful touch to the day. For those planning to venture out, it would be wise to don layers\u2014comfortable and breathable for the warmth ahead, yet ready for any lingering humidity from today\u2019s showers. Perhaps a stroll along the Charles River as the sun reclaims its place would be ideal. \n\nIn these fleeting moments of this evening, there is a serene charm woven into the fabric of a rain-kissed city\u2014a quiet anticipation of renewal wrapped in the soft night air.",
