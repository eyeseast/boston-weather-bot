Dress warmly\u2014a snug coat and sturdy boots will keep you comfortable against the brisk winds and chilly temperatures. Take this moment to appreciate the simple joy of the outdoors: a brisk walk through the neighborhood or a visit to one of Boston's serene parks. Embrace the wintry day, and allow it to remind you of the beauty in stillness.",
