    "weather_report": "In the quiet hours of tonight, Boston wears a cloak of serenity as the skies remain mostly clear, punctuated only by the occasional whisper of a gentle west wind. As the temperature dips to a cool embrace around twenty-eight degrees, the shimmering city lights twinkle against the dark canvas, casting a subtle glow upon the still streets. A solitude envelops the landscape, inviting moments of reflection or perhaps the simple pleasure of a warm drink enjoyed on a chilly balcony, where the crisp air brushes against the cheeks and stirs thoughts of warmer days ahead.\n\nAs dawn approaches, Wednesday will unfurl its canvas with a bright, sunny disposition. The promise of a high near forty-five brings a sense of renewal and hope, inviting residents to step outdoors, donning layers that balance warmth against the invigorating chill. A light northwest wind will accompany the sun's ascent, making this an ideal day for leisurely strolls along the river or for discovering hidden corners of the city. Enjoying a comforting cappuccino at an outdoor caf\u00e9 could be an exquisite way to bask in the sun's early rays, while the invigorating air refreshes the spirit. Whether wandering the historic streets or losing oneself in a good book under the expansive sky, the day ahead offers a perfect canvas for gentle exploration and the simple joys of the season.",
