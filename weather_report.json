    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the sky dons a heavy cloak of gray, for the clouds are not just mere visitors but rather a persistent companion wrapping the city in a cool embrace. With temperatures hovering around a mild 66 degrees, the persistent south wind carries with it a reminder of spring\u2019s awakening, though it breathes a more autumnal chill as gusts push through, dancing at 33 miles per hour. As the afternoon coasts toward evening, don't be fooled by the momentary clarity that may slip through; rain is set to make an appearance, ushered in by the very winds we now feel. Expect the gentle patter and patchy fog to emerge sometime after dusk, with a resolute chance of precipitation reaching a perfect 100%. \n\nOn a day like this, practicality in attire becomes paramount; a light waterproof jacket and perhaps a cozy scarf could make the journey through misty streets more pleasant. Heavy drops may find themselves pooling in the evening, teasing the possibility of a cozy movie night indoors or an inviting caf\u00e9 where the rain can drench the world outside while you sip something warm. Embrace the gentle hum of the city, where the sound of raindrops on pavement become a calming symphony, a prelude to more tranquil moments as day fades to night.",
