    "weather_report": "As twilight envelops Boston this evening, a gentle hush blankets the city. The air is crisp, whispering of autumn, with temperatures dipping gracefully to around 53 degrees. Underneath the muted glow of streetlamps and the twinkling lights from afar, the atmosphere feels calm and serene, inviting evening strolls through neighborhoods adorned with seasonal decor. A soft southwest breeze flickers through, just enough to rustle the leaves still clinging to their branches, creating a harmonious symphony of rustling foliage and city hum.\n\nLooking ahead to tomorrow, the sun will rise on a canvas of mostly sunny skies, a welcome invitation for outdoor endeavors as it warms the air, inviting highs near 80 later in the day. Those who venture out can expect a day that dances between warmth and a light breeze, making it perfect for a leisurely lunch at a favorite caf\u00e9 or perhaps an afternoon exploration of the gardens and parks where the last vestiges of fall foliage might still be admired. As the day unfolds, light layers will be your trusted companions; a comfortable shirt or a light sweater will suffice to enjoy the delightful embrace of an Indian summer.",
