    "weather_report": "In Boston, the afternoon sun bathes the landscape, casting a brilliant warmth that hints at the season's embrace. With temperatures inching toward the low nineties, the air shimmers under an azure sky, carrying whispers of a gentle southwest breeze. Although the humidity adds a touch of weight, it is paired with a vibrant clarity, making the day feel both bright and alive. As evening descends, expect the warmth to linger slightly, cooling just enough to greet the night at a comfortable seventy-one degrees.\n\nWith conditions so inviting, consider a leisurely stroll through one of Boston's historic neighborhoods or a quiet moment in the shade of a tree-lined park. Perhaps a visit to a riverside caf\u00e9 would be refreshing, allowing for a serene reprieve while soaking in the day's hues. Dress in light fabrics to embrace the warmth, a simple choice that allows the skin to breathe, complemented by comfortable footwear for spontaneous explorations. Tonight, as the sky transforms into a canvas of stars, the subtle sweetness of summer lingers, inviting you to savor the remnants of a glorious day.",
