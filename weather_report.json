    "weather_report": "As night gently releases its grip, Boston finds itself cloaked in a veil of cloudiness, the night air warm and whispering a promise of a steamy July morning. Currently, a low of 75 degrees envelopes the city, accompanied by a south wind that stirs lightly, reminiscent of a gentle caress. As dawn approaches, an early fog may cast its mysterious spell\u2014a quiet melody upon the waking streets, inviting an exploration of the hidden corners of the city.\n\nWith the sun poised to rise and chase away the fog by mid-morning, the day is set to transform into a sultry affair, the skies offering a tantalizing glimpse of sunshine amidst the depths of potential thunderstorms. Highs nearing 91 will flirt with a heat index of 98, a reminder that sweltering days are a hallmark of summer. Dressing lightly and sensibly is key\u2014think breathable fabrics and comfortable shoes for strolling through fragrant markets or shaded parks. As the clouds roll ominously in and out, the chance for a shower lingers, perhaps nudging one to carry a light jacket just in case. Given the conditions, mornings could be best spent in quiet contemplation, perhaps with a book in a nearby caf\u00e9, while afternoons might beckon a brisk walk along the Esplanade or a leisurely lunch beneath a sun-dappled tree. Enjoy the subtleties that today brings, navigating its blend of warmth and haze with ease and grace.",
