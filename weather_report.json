    "weather_report": "As the early hours of Saturday beckon, Boston lies cloaked in a gentle embrace of clouds, with the city slowly stirring to life under a canopy of partial clarity. The air, warm yet crisp, carries a promise of the day's adventures, as the low temperatures hover comfortably around 59 degrees. Expect the sun to challenge the clouds later, painting the skyline vibrant before yielding to the possibilities of scattered rain showers and the occasional rumble of thunder in the afternoon.\n\nFor those traversing the streets of this historic city, a light jacket or layered clothing will serve you well. The warmth should encourage you outside, perhaps to a cozy coffee shop for a mid-morning sip, or along winding paths where the foliage still whispers tales of spring. As the hours unfold, heed the clouds; they may gift you with a playful sprinkle as the wind dances in from the south. Embrace the day\u2019s unpredictability, let spontaneity guide your steps, and perhaps find solace in a quiet nook of a local park before the rains gently remind us of nature\u2019s touch.",
