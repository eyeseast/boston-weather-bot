    "weather_report": "The early morning in Boston drapes itself in the cool embrace of mostly cloudy skies. As the city stirs awake, the temperature hovers near 49 degrees, a gentle reminder of autumn's arrival wrapped in a soft northwest breeze, whispering promises of a day that will unfold. As the sun climbs, those clouds will part just enough to unveil a partly sunny canvas. The temperature will flirt with 62 degrees before dipping into a more subdued 56 by afternoon\u2014indicative of the day\u2019s fleeting warmth.\n\nThose venturing outside will find the air fresh and invigorating, ideal for a brisk morning stroll along the Charles River or perhaps a quiet moment on the benches of Boston Common. In dressing for these transitional hours, layering will be wise; a light sweater or jacket will provide comfort against the morning chill, making way for lighter attire as the sun dances higher in the sky. Anticipate the wind to pick up in the afternoon, lending a spirited rush that may beckon you to wrap a scarf around your neck for added coziness. The day encourages exploration, be it meandering through local markets, sipping on artisanal coffee in a quaint caf\u00e9, or discovering the charming, cobblestone-laden streets of Beacon Hill. The scene is set for a day that is simply Boston\u2014a blend of crisp air, sun-kissed moments, and the soulful hum of a city alive.",
