Today's promise is a high near 72, gently ushered in by a soft southwest breeze that lends an almost playful quality to the air. With no hint of fog disrupting the clarity, the city stands vibrant, beckoning you to step outside and bask in its embrace. Tonight, the temperature will settle near 52, inviting a sense of calm under a mostly clear sky, with a light west wind accompanying the transition into evening.\n\nIt is a wonderful morning, suggesting a wardrobe of light layers\u2014perhaps a comfortable cotton shirt and a light jacket for those cooler moments as the sun begins to dip. As the hours unfold, consider a leisurely stroll along the Charles River, where the water reflects the azure above, or find solace in a local caf\u00e9 with a sunlit patio, where you can sip a warm beverage while people-watching. The world feels open today, encouraging you to create simple yet meaningful moments as you meander through the rhythm of the city.",
