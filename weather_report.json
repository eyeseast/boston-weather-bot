    "weather_report": "As the evening deepens over Boston, the city unfurls beneath a cloaked canvas of mostly cloudy skies, casting a tranquil and somewhat somber ambiance. The temperature sinks down to around 40 degrees, with a gentle west wind whispering through the streets. This cooler night invites a cozy embrace; a plush sweater or a light jacket would be a suitable defense against the chilly air. The twinkling lights of the city shimmer like distant stars, offering an urban glow that juxtaposes the darkness of the night.\n\nWhen dawn breaks on Monday, a shift is upon us. The clouds will part, unveiling a canvas of blue, as mostly sunny skies bless the day with warmth. With a high near 60, the pulse of the city will awaken, and it will be an ideal time for a leisurely stroll along the waterfront or a quiet moment in one of Boston\u2019s charming parks. A light jacket should suffice during the morning chill, transforming into a comfortable long-sleeve as the sun climbs higher. It's a day for small adventures\u2014perhaps a pocket of time spent exploring lesser-known nooks of the city or sharing a quiet cup of coffee with a friend at an outdoor caf\u00e9.",
