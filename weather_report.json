    "weather_report": "As the city of Boston rests beneath a canopy of darkness, a pleasant stillness envelops the night, marked only by the distant twinkle of lights softly illuminating the Boston skyline. The air, crisp and invigorating, whispers of an approaching dawn that promises clarity and a touch of sunshine. With temperatures settling around a cool thirty-four degrees, a gentle breeze from the west adds a playful chill, beckoning for the comfort of a warm coat or a cozy scarf.\n\nCome Friday, the sun will rise and sweep away the remnants of night, giving way to a bright and sunny day with temperatures inching up to a modest forty-five degrees. This gentle warmth will feel refreshing against the backdrop of clear blue skies. It is a day that invites you outdoors, whether for a leisurely stroll through Boston Common, where the early light dances on the dewy grass, or perhaps an unhurried visit to a local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the air. Dress in layers, allowing for the cool early morning and the mild afternoon; don a sturdy jacket and perhaps a knitted hat to ward off the briskness of the day. For today\u2019s adventures, seek solace in the rhythm of a quiet city coming to life, where the mundane becomes a delightful tapestry of moments shared under the brightening sky.",
