    "weather_report": "As twilight descends upon Boston, a palpable tension lingers in the air, marked by the promise of imminent showers and distant rumblings of thunder. The skies above, a canvas of mottled gray, hint at the rainfall to come, while low-lying clouds weave a veil over the cityscape, turning the vibrancy of late evening into a softer, muted palette. With temperatures resting lightly around 65 degrees, the gentle northwest breeze whispers through the air, beckoning one to embrace the evening despite the approaching storms. The forecast suggests an 80% chance of precipitation, a nudge towards staying inside, perhaps wrapped in a cozy blanket with a good book, listening to the rhythmic percussion of raindrops against the window.\n\nTomorrow promises a contrasting demeanor, as the clouds disperse to reveal a predominantly sunny day, with temperatures climbing to a pleasant 78 degrees. In this fleeting summer warmth, one may find joy strolling along the Esplanade or collecting fresh produce at the local farmers' market. However, as dusk deepens into night, a light jacket may serve well against the cooling air. Thus, while tonight\u2019s weather suggests a gentle retreat into the comfort of home, tomorrow invites exploration and connection with the outdoors, even as the city wears the remnants of today's fleeting storms.",
