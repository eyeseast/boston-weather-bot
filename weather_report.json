The temperature sits comfortably at a mild 59 degrees, inviting you to step outside. The west wind whispers softly, rustling the leaves and carrying a hint of warmth that hints at the sun\u2019s impending embrace. \n\nBy midday, that fog will give way entirely, yielding to a sky of unblemished blue as the temperature climbs to a welcoming 83 degrees. Such a day is one to savor\u2014dynamic yet tranquil, perfect for an excursion along the Charles River or perhaps a leisurely stroll through one of Boston\u2019s historic neighborhoods, where each cobblestone seems to hold a story waiting to be told. Light attire\u2014perhaps a breathable cotton shirt paired with shorts\u2014would suit this pleasant weather, allowing you to bask in the sun's glow while maintaining ease. As the warmth envelops you, consider an impromptu caf\u00e9 visit, where you can indulge in the simple pleasure of a cool drink while soaking in the vibrant life that the city offers.",
