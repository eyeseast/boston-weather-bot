    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the sun breaks through, casting a warm glow that hints at a summer day filled with possibilities. With a balmy high nearing 90 degrees, the atmosphere feels ripe for outdoor endeavors. A gentle northeast breeze whispers through the streets, laced with just enough freshness to temper the warmth. As twilight beckons, the skies will shift into a soothing blanket of clarity, settling around a comfortable low of 70, inviting those drawn out by the day\u2019s splendor to linger under the stars.\n\nThis is a day made for leisurely strolls along the waterfront or perhaps a visit to a quiet caf\u00e9, where one can savor a chilled beverage while absorbing the vibrant energy of the city. Dress in light fabrics\u2014perhaps a crisp linen shirt paired with breathable cotton trousers\u2014as the sun's embrace can feel intense at midday. As evening approaches, a light layer would make the transition more comfortable against the gentle evening breeze. Regardless of the melting heat, the sky's promise of clear vistas encourages exploration, whether it be a quiet read in the park or a casual outing with friends.",
