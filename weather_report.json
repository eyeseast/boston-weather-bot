    "weather_report": "As the night envelops Boston, a gentle chill settles over the city, a reminder that winter is inching closer. The air is thick with the promise of rain, merging with the haze of patchy fog that steals in quietly. With temperatures hovering around the mid-thirties, it feels particularly cool, and the northeast breeze adds a briskness that nudges the senses awake. A chance of light rain lingers in the air, hinting at moisture that may come and go, teasing the night with its fleeting presence.\n\nOn the morrow, expect a muted day to unfold, with the clouds holding their sway over the skyline, offering a palette of greys and soft shadows. Amongst the fog, a slight drizzle may kiss the streets, but it\u2019s the lingering chill that will define the experience. Dressing in layers seems prudent; a warm coat, perhaps paired with a snug knit sweater below, will guard against the day\u2019s briskness. As for activities, consider a leisurely stroll along the waterfront, where the fog wraps the buildings in an ethereal embrace, or find refuge in a cozy caf\u00e9, savoring a warm drink while observing the world move a little slower under the clouds. The calm of the day suits quiet moments, giving way to reflection as the city holds its breath in anticipation of winter\u2019s deeper approach.",
