By morning, expect the fog to linger, perhaps obscuring familiar landmarks, while the promise of rain showers dances lightly in the breeze.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the veil of fog will draw back to reveal cloudy skies, with temperatures rising to a muted 71. An orchestra of rain showers may make their entrance, punctuated by the occasional rumble of thunder, creating a symphony of weather that matches the turning of the season. This is a day graced by the moisture of life, wherein a light jacket and well-prepared footwear will serve you well. An afternoon spent navigating the rich tapestry of Boston\u2019s streets, perhaps catching a quiet moment at a caf\u00e9 or revisiting a beloved bookstore, would be well complemented by a warm drink in hand. Those who seek solace in the rhythmic patter of rain may find pleasure in simple pursuits\u2014observe the rain-soaked foliage, or let the rhythm of the day guide you toward a hidden gallery. Embrace the gentle embrace of this late spring day, for it holds the beauty of renewal just beneath its cloudy surface.",
