High temperatures hover near a pleasant 80 degrees, an invitation for passersby to shed the confines of home and explore the lively streets or picturesque parks. With the sun still casting a golden hue, the evening beckons for light attire\u2014short sleeves and comfortable shorts will do well, perhaps complemented by a light sweater for those cooler moments as twilight approaches.\n\nTonight, the air continues its transition into a comfortable embrace, with temperatures dipping to around 56, fostering a serene atmosphere ideal for evening strolls or relaxed gatherings with friends outdoors. The mostly clear skies will unveil a tapestry of stars, perfect for those who enjoy contemplating the universe on a quiet Boston night.
