The low temperature sits comfortably around 61, making it a night best suited for settling into comforting layers. Eyes that linger upon the horizon might find a hint of light shimmering faintly in the distance, as the southwest wind nudges along a soft breeze, brushing against the skin like a whispered secret.\n\nAs morning rises, the dance of raindrops is poised to begin, cascading softly after the clock strikes nine. The air will thicken with anticipation as the day starts off mostly cloudy, with the heat reaching a cozy 76. A casual wander outside may be in order, where the gentle south winds beckon, yet one must be prepared for the likelihood of showers\u2014there\u2019s a solid chance that the clouds will release their burden, resulting in little more than a smattering of rain. Opting for a light raincoat or an umbrella would be wise, allowing one to embrace the warmth while remaining shielded, as the day unfolds with the promise of fresh scents mingling in the air. It is a fine opportunity to meander through local parks, savoring the muted beauty of droplets clinging to leaves, or perhaps to enjoy a caf\u00e9 visit, where the rhythmic sound of rain creates a comforting soundtrack to the afternoon.",
