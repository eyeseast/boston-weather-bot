    "weather_report": "The day unfolds in Boston beneath a shroud of clouds, creating an atmosphere that feels both contemplative and softly dreary. With the time nearing midday, a chance of rain showers lingers in the air, promising a brief interlude of dampness between noon and five. The high temperature, a modest 74 degrees, will float down to around 67, echoing the cool breath of spring just as it begins to yield to the warmth of summer. A gentle southwestern wind whispers through the leaves, though the overarching gloom of clouds might cast a veil over your spirit.\n\nAs twilight approaches, expect the rain to intensify, accompanied by the onset of patchy fog weaving its way into the evening. The temperatures will drop further to a cool 50, inviting you to layer up for the night ahead. A light jacket or sweater should suffice to ward off the chill while wandering through the quiet streets, perhaps discovering a favorite caf\u00e9 or tucked-away bookshop where the soft sounds of rain can accompany your thoughts. The forecast may hint at a changeable day, but with a little creativity, the evening presents an opportunity to embrace the tranquility that a rainy spring night brings.",
