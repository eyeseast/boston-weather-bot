    "weather_report": "The afternoon light in Boston spills over the city right now, as the clouds drift lazily across the sky, unhurried and trampling over an otherwise picturesque scene. There is a gentle east wind rustling the trees, a soft whisper that hints at the coming dusk. With a comfortable temperature hugging the upper sixties, it's a moment where one can\u2019t help but appreciate the open air and the clarity of the day. The air remains crisp, fresh enough to invigorate, and the humidity is held at bay, leaving the city in considerable comfort as evening approaches.\n\nAs the sun begins to descend, casting a golden hue across the horizon, the evening promises to be equally pleasant with temperatures dipping only slightly. It\u2019s a delightful time to take a leisurely stroll down the Esplanade, to savor the subtle aroma of autumn inching closer. A light jacket or a cozy sweater would serve well against the coolness settling in, perfect for coffee in hand as the day winds down. Perhaps one might find joy in visiting a nearby caf\u00e9, embracing the casual charm of Boston as conversations linger and laughter escapes into the fading light, a fitting response to such a serene day.",
