    "weather_report": "Good morning, Boston. As the sun rises to a high of nearly 93 degrees today, the city basks in the warmth, assuredly setting the stage for a day where the heat may soon feel heavy upon the skin. The heat index pushes the experience to a sweltering 101, hinting at the weight of the humidity that lingers in the air like an invisible blanket. The skies appear clear, yet a hint of haze softens the distant outlines, whispering of warmth that will soon envelop all in its embrace.\n\nTonight, as daylight gracefully yields to twilight, the temperature will cool to a steady 74 degrees, though the humidity will persist, potentially making it feel closer to 97. A gentle south wind carries the comforting scent of summer evenings, inviting you to linger out on the porch or take a stroll under the stars. Dress lightly; breathable fabrics are your allies today, and comfortable shoes will carry you to the local caf\u00e9 or along the river. Whether it's a casual meeting with friends or a quiet evening enjoying the warmth of a fire pit, today and tonight beckon with the promise of simple joys amid the summer heat.",
