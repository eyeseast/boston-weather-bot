    "weather_report": "Boston finds itself enveloped in a tender embrace of cloud and dampness this afternoon, as rain arrives, heralded by gusts of wind that whisper through the drab skies. The temperature hovers around a rather cool 51 degrees, offering little in the way of warmth, while the chance of precipitation dances at a modest 60%. The landscape outside is cloaked in muted hues, with the air saturated and thick\u2014a soft gray that speaks of lingering drizzles and the promise of a quiet afternoon. As twilight approaches, the rain's grip will ease only slightly, yielding to a mostly cloudy canvas with temperatures slipping towards that colder realm of 36 degrees.\n\nIn these conditions, layering becomes an art form. A sturdy jacket, preferably waterproof, will serve as a reliable shield against the elements. A scarf might provide comfort against the cool breaths of wind that ripple through the air. As the day winds down, consider steering clear of outdoor excursions\u2014perhaps now is the ideal time for a cozy afternoon spent indulging in a good book by the window, or practicing that hobby you\u2019ve put on the back burner. The allure of an intimate caf\u00e9, with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee blending with the soft sound of rain on the rooftops, beckons as a perfect refuge from the murky chill outside, inviting you to savor warmth and engage in the solace of quiet moments.",
