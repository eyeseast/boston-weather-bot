    "weather_report": "In Boston, the day unfolds under a tapestry of muted clouds, a gentle veil that softens the light and casts a serene but somewhat chilly ambiance over the city. With temperatures nudging up to a modest 45 degrees, a subtle east wind whispers through the streets, maintaining a cool underpinning that suggests layers will be your ally today. As the hours linger on, expect the clouds to keep their company, with evening shadows leaning toward a chilly low around 33 degrees, hinting at a night that will demand warm attire.\n\nWhile today may lack the warmth of sunlight, the atmosphere invites a range of tranquil pursuits. Consider taking a leisurely stroll along the Charles River, where the soft sounds of water juxtapose with the quiet of the grey skies. Should you venture out, a cozy sweater layered beneath a sturdy coat will keep the chill at bay. Alternatively, you might find comfort in a local caf\u00e9, indulging in a warm drink while watching the world pass by\u2014a perfect way to embrace the day's mood. Such moments of simple pleasure are the quiet joys that resonate beautifully against the backdrop of a softly overcast sky.",
