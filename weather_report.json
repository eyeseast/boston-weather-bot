    "weather_report": "As dusk unfolds over Boston, the sky transforms into a serene canvas, presenting a blend of deep navy and muted hints of twilight. The air grows still, and the low temperature whispers hints of a chill that beckons a cozy embrace, perhaps in the form of a lightweight scarf or a soft jacket. Tonight\u2019s air is crisp, carrying with it the faint rustle of the early spring, the gentle reminder of winter\u2019s retreat while still holding onto moments of coolness.\n\nWith the dawn on the horizon, the morrow promises to awaken with sunny grace, the kind of day that stirs the soul and invites leisurely strolls through the city. A high near sixty-two degrees will lace the day with warmth, so thoughtfully choose your attire\u2014something breathable yet layered, allowing for the joy of being outdoors while still being prepared for that occasional breeze. It\u2019s a splendid time to wander through the parks or perhaps visit a local caf\u00e9, basking in the sunlight streaming through budding leaves. The ensuing hours promise to cradle citizens in an embrace of vibrancy, urging a sigh of gratitude for the fleeting beauty of spring.",
