    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Boston, a veil of clouds drapes gently across the sky, with pinpricks of urban light flickering in the distance like distant stars. The air, crisp and biting, carries the whisper of a possible flurry, though nothing substantial is expected tonight. Temperatures are dipping into the lower twenties, inviting a brisk chill that wraps around your collar and seeps through the fibers of your clothing. It is not a night for lingering outdoors, but the tranquil vibe of the city offers a comforting backdrop for those who venture out, perhaps for a warm drink or a stroll along the quieter avenues, where the evening buzz feels like a fading echo.\n\nTomorrow brings a sliver of hope for snow around the late afternoon, dressed in clouds and a hint of dreariness. With a forecast high of 36 degrees, the day promises moments of clarity juxtaposed with the understated melancholy of winter skies. It\u2019s advisable to bundle up well; a hearty coat, snug gloves, and a scarf will make encounters with the brisk air all the more bearable. As the weekend unfolds, consider a visit to your favorite local caf\u00e9, where the aroma of fresh brews mingles with the gentle hum of conversation, or perhaps take a moment to explore indoor galleries that beckon with warmth and inspiration. In this atmosphere of muted tones and subtle beauty, Boston reveals its charm, urging you to savor the quiet joys found in its embrace.",
