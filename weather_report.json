    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Boston, an enveloping calm blankets the city. The skies are mostly clear, allowing the warmth of the July evening to linger, with temperatures settling around a balmy 72 degrees. A light southwest breeze dances lightly through, whispering promises of the warmth to come as dawn approaches. The city lights twinkle against the dark canvas of night, hinting at the vibrancy that will embrace the day ahead.\n\nCome morning, the sun will rise to reveal a tableau of mostly sunny skies, albeit with the possibility of rain showers and thunderstorms creeping in during the afternoon. With highs soaring near a sweltering 95 degrees, the heat will press upon the city's pulse, making even the briefest moments of shade feel like a refuge. Those venturing outdoors should dress lightly, perhaps in breathable cottons, and carry along an umbrella as a prudent companion, for the forecast holds a 50% chance of precipitation. As the sun casts its glow, take a leisurely stroll along the Charles River, find solace in the embrace of a local caf\u00e9, or explore the quaint streets of Back Bay, sans any of the crowd's usual urgency. Embrace the summer warmth while it lasts, holding close the evening chills that follow.",
