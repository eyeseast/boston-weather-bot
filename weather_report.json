Tonight, the sky reveals itself with an expanse of clarity, draping a sense of tranquility over the evening\u2019s unfolding. A low of 68 hangs in the air, inviting residents to choose their attire with a care for comfort\u2014perhaps a light shirt and breathable fabric that allow for the touch of the night while keeping the warmth at bay. \n\nAs dawn breaks on Sunday, one can anticipate a sun-drenched canvas, where the mercury will rise to near 91 under the watchful gaze of scattered clouds. The promise of scattered rain showers later in the afternoon brings with it a curious anticipation for relief from the heat, as the heat index might flirt with 96. With a modest chance of rain, it might be wise to have an umbrella at hand, just in case nature decides to sprinkle some unexpected charm on the day. Activities beckon from every corner\u2014an afternoon stroll along the banks of the Charles or perhaps a leisurely gathering at a favorite caf\u00e9, where laughter and conversation dance in the warm air, perfectly capturing the essence of summer in the city. Tonight beckons relaxation, while tomorrow holds the potential for a vibrant day steeped in warmth and shared moments.",
