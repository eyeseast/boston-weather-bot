    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the sun casts its gentle glow through a clear sky, rising notable warmth that tops near 87. The air is infused with a light northwesterly breeze, an invitation to step outside and savor the fresh, warm embrace of summer. As the day beckons, the outlook is decidedly pleasant, the kind of day that prompts strollers to venture down tree-lined streets or friends to gather at a caf\u00e9 where laughter mingles with the scent of fresh-brewed coffee.\n\nAs evening approaches, the air will cool to a comfortable 66, an ideal time for leisurely twilight walks along the Charles River or picnics in the park. Dressing in light, breathable fabrics will serve well during the day, while a light jacket or shawl may be appreciated later as the chill of night settles in. One might find joy in an impromptu gathering in a friend\u2019s backyard or a quiet evening reading beneath the stars, all while soaking in the sweetness of a New England summer night.",
