    "weather_report": "As the early evening unfolds over Boston, a blanket of patchy fog lingers like a whisper, shading the landscape in gentle gray. The air feels cool, enveloping everything in a quiet embrace with a high of 65 earlier in the day. The potential for light rain showers shimmers faintly on the horizon, lending an almost poetic quality to the ambiance. The sky hangs heavy with clouds, and the atmosphere carries a scent of earth and moisture, inviting introspection.\n\nAs the day edges toward night, temperatures will dip to about 53, encouraging layered comfort\u2014a light jacket or a cozy sweater will serve well against the evening\u2019s chill. It\u2019s an ideal time for strolls along the Charles, where the fog adds a mysterious charm to the river\u2019s shimmering surface. Perhaps one might savor a warm drink at a local caf\u00e9, watching the world drift by through misty panes. The chance of rain looms at a modest 30%, but it hardly seems a deterrent; rather, it offers a chance to revel in the tranquil beauty of a city that wears its weather with grace.",
