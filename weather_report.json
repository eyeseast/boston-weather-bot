    "weather_report": "As Boston awakens to the soft embrace of early morning, a gentle veil of patchy fog cloaks the city, promising a tranquil start to the day. The cool air, tinged with the crispness of approaching spring, hovers around 38 degrees, hinting at a gradual ascent toward a more inviting afternoon, where sunbeams will break through the clouds, nudging temperatures close to a comfortable 59. The breeze is reluctant, whispering softly from the south at just a couple of miles per hour, further enhancing the serene ambiance that envelops the skyline.\n\nIn these quiet hours, the world feels still, with the fog adding an air of mystery to city streets. As the day unfolds, the hazy shroud is expected to lift before mid-morning, giving way to a delightful blend of sunshine and scattered clouds. It would be wise to dress in layers\u2014perhaps a light sweater paired with a jacket for the early chill, before shedding them to embrace the day\u2019s warmth. As for activities, consider a leisurely walk along the Charles River, where the reflections on the water capture the subtle emergence of spring, or perhaps a gentle stroll through Boston Common, where budding blooms hint at the seasons\u2019 transition. It\u2019s a day for simplicity, a chance to savor the quiet beauty of an awakening city.",
