It\u2019s a night best suited for quiet reflection or an intimate gathering, perhaps a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 swirling with the aroma of coffee, where the rain's patter on the windows creates a snug backdrop.\n\nTomorrow will dawn bright and crisp, promising clear skies that will allow the sun to warm the day to a pleasant 40 degrees. With a gentle west wind cascading through the streets, it\u2019s an ideal day for a leisurely stroll along the Charles River, with clear views of the cityscape shimmering beneath the sunshine. A light jacket and sturdy shoes will serve well, inviting spontaneous exploration of Boston's vibrant neighborhoods.
