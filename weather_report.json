    "weather_report": "As the clock approaches evening in Boston, the city's whispering streets are laced with a soft, uncertain chill. Veils of patchy fog hang in the air, coiling like tendrils from the ground as light snowflakes begin to dance, blurring the edges of a slightly overcast horizon. The early hours will witness an interlude between winter's grasp and the promise of milder temperatures \u2013 a delicate balance, with lows retreating to around 25, then ascending towards 34 as the night unfolds. The Southwest wind, gentle yet persistent, carries the scent of damp earth and icy air, inviting residents to wrap themselves in warmth before stepping out into the muted glow of streetlights.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will shake off the night\u2019s embrace, revealing a clearer sky where light will spill forth generously onto the cityscape, beckoning one to venture outside. A high near 42 will offer a refreshing escape from the chill that lingered just hours prior. For those wandering down brick-paved streets or through the serene parks, layering up will be wise \u2014 a cozy sweater beneath a stylish overcoat could match both the pleasant sunlit hours and the cool breeze that occasionally sweeps through. Consider a quiet stroll along the river or perhaps an afternoon spent at a quaint caf\u00e9, where the warmth of a hot drink contrasts perfectly with the crispness just beyond the windows. As dusk approaches again, it may be the ideal canvas for reflection, a moment of stillness brought forth by winter's embrace through soft whispers of fog and gentle snow.",
