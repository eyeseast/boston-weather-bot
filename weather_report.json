    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, the sky is cloaked in a tapestry of muted clouds, whispering of a change in the air. The temperature dances around 73 degrees, cooling to a gentle 67 as the hours wane. A soft east wind, playful yet unrelenting, carries the promise of moisture, hinting at the chance of showers and the distant rumbles of evening thunderstorms. As twilight approaches, the likelihood of patchy fog looms like a specter in the distance, inviting introspection and perhaps a quiet evening indoors.\n\nIn light of these shifting conditions, it's best to dress in layers, a light sweater or jacket complementing the day\u2019s warmth, preparing you for the coolness that beckons after sunset. A stroll through Boston's inviting streets might reveal hidden gems\u2014perhaps a quiet caf\u00e9 where you can savor a warm drink, or a tranquil park bench where you can reflect as nature gently transitions into nightfall. The air may soon be tinged with drops of rain and the delicate embrace of fog, creating a serene backdrop for a contemplative evening in the city.",
