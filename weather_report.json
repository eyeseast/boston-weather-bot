    "weather_report": "As the night settles over Boston, a quiet chill lingers in the air, underscored by the soft glow of city lights peeking through the dark. With temperatures dipping to a modest low, the scene invites a reflective solitude, perfect for those tucked warmly in their homes or bundled up for an evening stroll. The wind brushes against the skin, gently urging a reminder of winter\u2019s lingering grip, though there\u2019s promise of change on the horizon.\n\nLooking ahead to Monday, the atmosphere hints at a rather unsettled day filled with a tapestry of weather conditions. Morning hours bring the possibility of snow intermingling with patches of fog, cloaking the city in a delicate mystery. By afternoon, expect a thick embrace of clouds with a blend of rain and snow, as the southeast breeze stirs up energy, adding a touch of drama to the otherwise muted palette of nature. Given these conditions, it would be wise to don layers\u2014a warm coat, scarf, and perhaps even waterproof boots. It\u2019s a day that beckons for quiet joys, like the comfort of a caf\u00e9, a collection of books, or a leisurely conversation with a friend, as the world outside transforms under the weight of moisture and fog.",
