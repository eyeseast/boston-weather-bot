With temperatures dipping down into the lower teens, the gentle north wind brushes past, adding a slight chill that wraps around you. Tonight\u2019s sky is mostly clear, allowing the stars to flicker above like distant lanterns, a serene backdrop to the city\u2019s glimmering lights below. The streets, softened by the absence of fog, reveal a peaceful landscape, the occasional car gliding by, illuminating patches of the road with fleeting beams.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday, anticipations hold the promise of mostly sunny skies that will allow the sun to stretch its rays over the city. At a high near the thirties, it\u2019s a day that calls for layered attire\u2014perhaps a sturdy jacket over a warm sweater, complemented by a cozy scarf to ward off the lingering chill. As you wander through the stillness of the morning, the serenity offers a perfect opportunity to explore local parks or enjoy a leisurely stroll along the waterfront. The clean, crisp air is invigorating, making a steaming cup of coffee or tea a delightful companion for the day. As night comes, the city will once again twinkle under the watchful gaze of a clear sky, a fitting close to the weekend\u2019s brisk but lovely embrace.",
