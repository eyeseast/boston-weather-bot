    "weather_report": "The night in Boston envelops the city in a tranquil darkness, the soft glow of distant lights offering a glimmer of warmth against the chill that nips at the air. As the hours creep towards dawn, the temperature hovers around a crisp 20 degrees, with a gentle northwest breeze whispering through the streets. The sky remains mostly clear, a promising canvas for the day ahead, although a slight chance of snow looms in the late afternoon, hinting at a delicate transformation in the weather fabric.\n\nAs dawn breaks and the sun ascends, expect a mostly sunny day, where the warmth of the sun might invite the city's residents outdoors. With a high nearing 36 degrees, layering is essential. A cozy sweater or a light jacket paired with a scarf will serve well against the brisk winds. For those venturing out, this is a perfect day for a reflective walk along the Charles River or perhaps a leisurely stroll through the Boston Common, where the aroma of fresh coffee beckons from nearby cafes. As evening approaches, a sense of anticipation builds with the possibility of snowflakes gracing the sidewalks, adding a delicate charm to the Boston landscape.",
