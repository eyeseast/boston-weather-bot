    "weather_report": "As the quiet hours of the evening blanket Boston, the temperatures hover comfortably just above 70, presenting a calm and clear sky. A gentle breeze whispers through the trees, creating a serene atmosphere perfect for late-night strolls or unwinding on a porch with a cool drink in hand. However, as the dawn unfurls with the promise of a scorching Tuesday, anticipation builds for what lies ahead. \n\nCome daybreak, the sun will emerge triumphantly, basking the city in radiant warmth, with temperatures soaring towards 97. The day will demand resilience, as heat indices tiptoe into the territory of discomfort. This is a day best approached with light fabrics and breathable attire, perhaps a casual linen shirt paired with loose-fitting shorts, whatever keeps you cool against the sweltering embrace of the sun. Indoors, the bliss of air conditioning will call; outside, the charm of a well-placed shaded caf\u00e9 can be too tempting to resist. Perhaps a languid afternoon spent sipping iced tea and reading a book under a wide-brimmed hat could offer refuge from the fiery sun. Embrace the day's opportunities but do so with care, for this is a day to navigate the heat with ease and grace.",
