    "weather_report": "As the night deepens in Boston, the city is shrouded in a gentle stillness, with only the twinkling lights punctuating the darkness. The air, carrying the chill of early September, hovers around a crisp 52 degrees and is stirred softly by a north wind. This nighttime tranquility prepares the stage for a bright tomorrow, where the sky promises a pristine canvas of sunshine, warming the day to a comfortable 77 degrees. \n\nWith clarity set to grace the dawn, it would be wise to embrace this inviting charm. Dressing in light layers will allow one to transition seamlessly from the coolness of the morning to the sun\u2019s embrace by noon. As the day unfolds, consider a stroll along the Harborwalk, where the gentle lapping of the water accompanies the rise of the sun. Alternatively, a leisurely visit to the local farmers' market could offer the delights of the season, all while soaking in the vibrant atmosphere. With such favorable conditions ahead, take a moment to breathe in the promise of a splendid day waiting just beyond the horizon.",
