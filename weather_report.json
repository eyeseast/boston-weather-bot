    "weather_report": "As the night deepens over Boston, a blanket of clouds veils the city\u2019s charm, ushering in a chill that lingers in the air. Under the muted glow of the urban lights, the temperature hovers around a brisk 21 degrees, whispering promises of a gradual warming through the night. The northwest wind stirs softly, echoing the quietude of a winter eve, though its presence carries a hint of what tomorrow may bring\u2014a blend of rain and fog that could weave a hazy tapestry across the streets. \n\nFriday beckons, presenting a canvas painted with gray skies and a likelihood of rain by late morning, emerging from the damp chill that has enveloped the city. Expect a high near 39, a modest elevation as the grey sky seems to press gently upon the horizon. For those venturing out, dressing in layers will be crucial; a warm piece against the chill, complemented by a waterproof shell, will help navigate the dampness that lingers in the air and the roads. The forecast hints at obscured visibility, giving you the perfect excuse to find solace indoors\u2014perhaps an intimate caf\u00e9 where the rich aroma of coffee mingles with soft jazz, or a cozy bookstore inviting you to lose track of time within its pages. For those who embrace the outdoors despite the weather, a stroll under the canopy of clouds may evoke an invigorating breath of fresh, crisp air, tailored to those unafraid of a little rain.",
