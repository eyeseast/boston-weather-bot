The clouds hang low, cloaking the skyline in a shroud that has yet to release its wintry gift, the temperature teetering around a brisk twenty-one degrees. Wandering the streets tonight, one might feel the cool breath of a gentle southwest wind, encouraging a light scarf wrapped snugly around the neck, and perhaps thick mittens to shield the fingers from the creeping chill. \n\nAs Friday dawns, a shift awaits, revealing a canvass of mostly sunny skies that will warm the day to a comfortable thirty-five. The sun will stretch its golden arms, inviting a leisurely stroll through the city\u2019s quiet avenues, where the remnants of winter\u2019s embrace glisten in the light. This transition calls for layers\u2014a warm jacket to fend off the lingering cold of morning, trading heavier attire for lighter apparel as the day unfolds. A local caf\u00e9 beckons with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, offering respite amidst the lively bustle, a delightful corner to savor a moment of stillness before the weekend sweeps in.",
