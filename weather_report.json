    "weather_report": "As dawn breaks over Boston, a gentle curtain of clouds intersperses the evening sky, offering a serene backdrop to the twinkling city lights slowly yielding to the approaching day. The temperature rests comfortably at 65, hinting at an inviting warmth for those who arise with the morning light. The vestiges of night linger softly, cradled by a barely perceptible west wind that brushes past like a whisper, creating an air of tranquility.\n\nAs the day unfolds, residents can expect the sun to rise high, casting a brilliant shine over the skyline and bathing the streets in a warm embrace, reaching towards 87 degrees. With a subtle east wind stirring, it promises to be a delightful summer day. For those stepping out, lightweight fabrics and breathable attire will be the allies against the heat, perhaps complemented with a light layer for those early hours when the air is still crisp. A leisurely stroll through the parks, perhaps a visit to the waterfront, or a quiet hour in a cafe enjoying a book could be perfect ways to savor the day\u2014simple pleasures that let one bask in the beauty of the moment.",
