    "weather_report": "As dawn begins to break over Boston, a veil of clouds drapes the city like a delicate shawl, hinting at the possibility of gentle showers in the hours to come. The air carries a chill, whispering of a low temperature around fifty-six degrees, wrapped in a light southerly breeze. The dim light reveals a scene that lacks vibrancy, casting a muted palette upon the familiar skyline, a reminder that nature has her moods.\n\nThroughout the day, expect the clouds to linger, with a chance of rain showers weaving through the afternoon hours. The high will push near sixty-four degrees, a dignified yet cool embrace. While a south-easterly wind rustles through, a soft sweater or light jacket will serve you well against the nippy air. Take the time to explore inside this city, perhaps lingering over a warm cup at a local caf\u00e9 or delving into the pages of a book in a cozy nook. With the possibility of rain lingering, an indoor art exhibit or a leisurely visit to a museum could offer the perfect retreat from the weather, transforming an overcast day into an opportunity for quiet delight.",
