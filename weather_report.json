    "weather_report": "In Boston this morning, the air is crisp and invigorating, the sun peeking through with a gentle radiance that invites residents to embrace the day. With temperatures hovering around a refreshing 42 degrees, the southwest wind whispers through the streets, creating a ruffled carpet of leaves. As the hours drift lazily toward noon, you might note a pleasing clarity in the sky\u2014a suggestion of blue that dances with the softened tones of winter's fading grip. Though clouds linger benignly overhead, they cast a delicate veil rather than a shroud, promising not to darken your journey.\n\nAs dusk approaches, the temperature will dip modestly, settling near 22, so layering will be your ally. A snug jacket paired with a cozy scarf will ward off the evening chill, while a hat might add a touch of warmth as you stroll or enjoy a leisurely evening coffee by the window. Consider visiting a local caf\u00e9, where the hum of conversation mingles with the aroma of freshly brewed espresso, offering a perfect respite from the cool outdoor air. Embrace the spirit of the season, seek out a cozy nook, and let the comforting ambiance of Boston cradle you this evening as the stars begin their watch over the city.",
