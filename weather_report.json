    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, the sky is adorned with a tapestry of cotton-like clouds, casting playful shadows on the landscape. The temperature hovers in the warm embrace of summer, while the air carries the sweet anticipation of potential showers and thunderstorms as twilight approaches. Though the chance of rain remains low, the thickening clouds may offer a brief respite from the sun's intensity, revealing a day that feels balmy yet breezy, with whispers of stirring winds. As the clock approaches evening, the horizon hints at a softer light, wrapping the city in a gauzy warmth that invites one to linger outdoors.\n\nFor those contemplating their evening plans, a casual stroll along the Esplanade or a visit to one of Boston\u2019s nestled caf\u00e9s could be the perfect way to soak in the atmosphere. Light layers are advisable; a comfortable tee paired with a breezy cardigan can adapt seamlessly to the shifting temperatures and unexpected turns of the weather. As you venture out, keep an open heart for the day's gentle cornucopia of sounds\u2014laughter echoing from nearby parks, the distant notes of a street musician, and the mellowing bustle of life winding down for the night.",
