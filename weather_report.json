    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, the sun bathes the city in a warm, golden light, inviting all to bask in its glow. With temperatures gently kissing the 78-degree mark, the gentle northeast breeze meanders through the streets, carrying the scent of summer\u2014fresh grass, blooming flowers, and perhaps a faint hint of salt from the nearby harbor. The skies stretch wide and clear, presenting a canvas of azure where the only brushstrokes are the wisps of cottony clouds drifting lazily by, reminding us of the ease that fills the air.\n\nThis evening promises to carry the tranquility of the day into night, as temperatures will lower into the comforting embrace of 62 degrees. A subtle shift in wind direction brings a southwest whisper, inviting serendipitous evening strolls through the historic avenues or dinners al fresco, where the crisp dusk can be enjoyed in good company. Dress lightly but prepare for a touch of coolness as the sun gives way to twilight; a light sweater may serve as a fine companion as day melds into night. Consider indulging in a quiet read at a local caf\u00e9, or perhaps take a moment to sit in one of Boston\u2019s many parks, savoring the gentle transition from warm day to serene evening.",
