    "weather_report": "As dusk settles softly over Boston, the atmosphere is wrapped in a gentle cloak of cloud cover, lending the evening a serene yet muted quality. The forecast promises a tranquil drop in temperature, settling around a comfortable 49 degrees with a subtle northwest breeze stirring just enough to keep the air fresh and inviting. For those venturing out this evening, a light jacket or sweater will be perfectly suited to ward off the coolness that descends as the day gives way to night.\n\nLooking ahead to Memorial Day, the sun is poised to grace the city with its presence, revealing the vibrant hues of spring in a delightful dance of warmth. With a high near 67 expected, the emerging clarity of the day invites leisurely strolls along the riverbank or a casual picnic in one of the nearby parks. As flowers bloom and leaves unfurl, it\u2019s an ideal time to appreciate the splendor of urban green spaces or perhaps sip coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 while watching the world go by. In this gentle embrace of pleasant weather, connect with the rhythm of the weekend; let the simplicity of fresh air and comforting company fill your heart with joy.",
