    "weather_report": "As the evening settles over Boston, the city is cloaked in a quiet chill, punctuated only by the whisper of the west wind and the potential for isolated snow showers skimming through moments before dusk. The temperatures are expected to drop into the mid-twenty range, wrapping everything in a brisk embrace that invites cozy layers of wool and soft down jackets. Tonight holds a certain allure, with the darkened sky scattered with stars peeking through ragged cloud cover, hinting at the colder air that steals the breath and invites a slower pace.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will rise over the horizon, promising a day of clarity nestled safely between the winter's chill, accompanied by the playful dance of sunny intervals. A high near thirty-eight will beckon those who can withstand the briskness of the wind, encouraging leisurely strolls along the Charles or the quiet contemplation found within a favorite caf\u00e9, warming hands around a mug of something steaming. The streets, although brisk, will feel friendly enough under the watchful eye of the sun, suggesting that perhaps a light scarf or a knitted hat is all that's needed for a day spent lingering in the outdoors. Whether it's the quiet charm of reading near a window or an afternoon at the park, tomorrow holds simplicity wrapped in the soothing balm of winter sunlight.",
