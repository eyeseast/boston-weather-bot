    "weather_report": "In the stillness of night, Boston rests beneath a velvety sky, the city lights twinkling like scattered jewels. The air is brisk, with a distinct chill settling in as temperatures drop to a crisp 17 degrees. A gentle north wind whispers through the hushed streets, adding to the quiet serenity of the early hours. As dawn approaches, it promises a mostly sunny day, lifting spirits along with the mercury to a more inviting 36 degrees. \n\nDressed in layers, one would do well to wrap up warmly with a snug scarf and perhaps a woolen hat, allowing the comfort of warmth to accompany you on a stroll along the Charles River, where the reflections dance playfully on the water. The retreating chill invites a rhythm of simple pleasures; a leisurely walk in a sunlit park or a visit to a cozy caf\u00e9 to enjoy a steaming cup of coffee. The clarity of the day beckons, suggesting a perfect opportunity to enjoy the idyllic architecture of the city, or perhaps indulge in a window-shopping expedition, as the shops await their patrons with open doors and welcoming displays.",
