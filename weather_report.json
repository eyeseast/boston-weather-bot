The temperature edges toward a comfortable warmth, inviting locals to step outside and enjoy the moment. A soft southeast breeze rustles through the trees, infusing the air with a hint of freshness\u2014a perfect contrast to the vibrant warmth enveloping the surroundings. \n\nAs evening approaches, the transition will bring a veil of patchy fog beginning to weave through the cityscape\u2014a shifting curtain of mystery that adds a touch of magic to the night. With a lower temperature easing in, one might consider light layers for comfort, perhaps a breezy shirt or a light jacket as night falls. This gentle weather encourages a stroll along the waterfront or an informal gathering with friends at an outdoor caf\u00e9, allowing the lingering light of the day to blend seamlessly with the emerging softness of the night. Slowly, the day fades, and Boston prepares to wrap itself in the serene lull of twilight.",
