    "weather_report": "Boston enjoys a gentle afternoon, as the sky presents a tapestry of soft clouds against an expanse of blue, lending a calming touch to the day. With a high approaching 73 degrees, the warmth invites one to step outside and relish the first hints of a budding summer. A light southwest breeze flits through the streets, rustling leaves and gently swaying the branches overhead. While there\u2019s only a modest probability of rain showers this afternoon, the air feels refreshing; a reminder that the weather can never truly be tamed.\n\nAs the sun dips lower in the sky, transitioning into evening, the atmosphere becomes more tranquil. With nighttime temperatures settling around 53 degrees, a light jacket or a cozy sweater will complement your evening stroll or casual outing. This is an ideal time to wander along the Charles River, perhaps indulging in a quiet moment at a nearby caf\u00e9, or simply absorbing the vibrant energy of the city. The slight chance of evening rain should not hinder plans but provides a quaint backdrop for those lingering over dinner or engaged in heartfelt conversation. Embrace the day\u2019s simplicity and enjoy the subtle beauty Boston has to offer.",
