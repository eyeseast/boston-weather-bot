    "weather_report": "As the afternoon unfolds in Boston, the sun breaks through the lingering clouds, casting a gentle warmth over the city, with a touch of hope for a pleasant day. With a high near 23 degrees, the air feels crisp, but the south wind carries a softness that whispers of winter\u2019s retreat, at least for now. Those venturing out will find the day inviting, although layers remain essential\u2014think of a warm coat, perhaps a scarf, to stave off the chill once the sun dips below the horizon. \n\nAs night approaches, clouds will thicken, bringing with them a hint of unpredictability. A chance of snow lurks in the air, a mere 30% chance, yet a reminder that winter\u2019s embrace is still palpable. For those considering evening plans, cozy activities may be in order, such as visiting local shops or enjoying a warm beverage at a quaint caf\u00e9, where conversation and laughter can flow as freely as the steam from your cup. The evening promises a quiet charm, punctuated by the soft glow of lights reflecting off the snow, an invitation to savor the simple joys of the season.",
