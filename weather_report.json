    "weather_report": "As the afternoon drapes its curtain over Boston, a gentle veil of clouds settles in, muting the brilliance of the day. The air carries a whisper of humidity, coaxing the temperature down from a peak of 71 to a more tempered 65. A light breeze stirs softly, giving clues to the slight chance of rain it's friendly with, which lingers like a thought just out of reach, a gentle tickle on the back of the neck. Although the skies wear a drab gray, the city pulses with life beneath the muted light.\n\nAs evening approaches, the air cools further, sliding to a sighing 61, perhaps inviting a light jacket or a cozy sweater to ward off the chill. With the possibility of a few errant raindrops before midnight, one might consider a casual stroll through the urban tapestry, soaking in the moody stillness that cloaks the streets, perhaps enjoying a coffee from a nearby caf\u00e9 or engaging in some light conversation al fresco, as Boston's charm often invites. Inside, the atmosphere feels serene, offering hidden corners for quiet reflection or intimate gatherings, perfect for those preferring the softer side of summer.",
