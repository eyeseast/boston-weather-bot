    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches, Boston lies in tranquil slumber, the air sharp and refreshing, tinged with the promise of a clear morning. The temperature, resting gently around 37 degrees, invites a soft layer\u2014perhaps a light jacket or a cozy sweater\u2014to fend off the remnants of night\u2019s chill. The whispers of a west wind brush past, almost imperceptible and serene, creating a stillness that speaks to the beauty of early hours.\n\nAs Friday unfolds, the city is set to bask in the warmth of the sun, with temperatures climbing towards a pleasant 66 degrees. The day promises sunshine, dancing breezes from the southwest, and gusts that may playfully tousle one\u2019s hair. It\u2019s the kind of day that beckons residents to abandon their routines. Perhaps a leisurely stroll through the Common, where the blooms are beginning to break through the last vestiges of winter, or a quiet afternoon at a local caf\u00e9, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingling with the sweet scents of spring. Dressing in layers will be wise; a light coat over your ensemble can provide comfort against the early coolness while seamlessly transitioning to the mild embrace of the afternoon sun. With all the colors of the day awaiting you, there is a palpable sense of joy in the air\u2014an invitation to take a moment, savor life's details, and relish the beauty of this evolving urban tapestry.",
