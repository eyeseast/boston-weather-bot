    "weather_report": "In Boston today, the afternoon light bathes the city in a gentle embrace, with a promising clarity that dances across the horizon. As you step outside, you'll find a refreshing chill in the air, a reminder that despite the sunny facade, winter still lingers like an old acquaintance. The sky, a soft blue canvas, invites you to revel in its simplicity, though wispy clouds drift lazily above, hinting at the night's possibilities. As temperatures hover around 45 degrees, bundled layers will serve you well. A light jacket, perhaps accompanied by a cozy scarf, is the perfect antidote to the cool northeastern breeze that stirs intermittently.\n\nAs dusk approaches, a slight murmuring of snow showers may grace the evening hours, though they will come with only a whisper of intention. With a low settling near 31, the calmness of the approaching night may prompt a quiet evening indoors or perhaps an urban wander to admire the twinkling lights as they flicker to life. Enjoy an afternoon stroll through the vibrant streets, maybe pause for a warm drink, and relish the subtle magic that this transition brings. While the allure of the sun is strong, let the impending evening's hint of snow be a gentle nudge to embrace the warmth of home and the cozy moments that await.",
