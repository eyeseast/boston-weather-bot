    "weather_report": "In Boston, the morning unfolds under a shroud of rain and overcast skies, where the air feels as though it is imbued with the heavy essence of impending storms. A gentle but relentless northeast wind carries the scent of damp earth and fallen leaves, the whispers of a chill that nips at the skin. As the day progresses, expect the rain to persist, drenching the streets and softening the sounds of the city. With the clouds hanging low, visibility dims, offering a somewhat moody backdrop to the morning commute, rendering the world muted in shades of gray. \n\nFor those venturing out, a sturdy umbrella and a warm, waterproof jacket will serve as faithful companions. The prevailing wetness combined with cooler temperatures invites reflective moments indoors, perhaps with a good book to savor while listening to the rain dance against the windowpanes. A cozy caf\u00e9 with a steaming cup of coffee could provide solace as the landscape outside remains drenched and dramatic. As evening approaches, the rain will continue, accompanied by gusty winds, perfect for snuggling in or enjoying a leisurely evening with friends, sharing stories of the storm's caprices.",
