Rain is expected to descend gently throughout the night, interspersed with a hushed drizzle, mingling with patchy fog that will undoubtedly soften the edges of familiar sights. The wind whispers from the southeast, adding a slight chill to the already crisp air, creating an ambiance that speaks of cozy indoor pursuits rather than outdoor adventures. With temperatures tumbling to around 39, the chill may cling to your skin, so layering may be wise\u2014a comfortable sweater, perhaps, paired with a light waterproof jacket to guard against the night\u2019s dampness. \n\nTomorrow paints a similar picture, as the day dawns cloudy and damp, with a high lingering around 43. The frequent promise of rain lingers like an old tune, hinting at moments best spent indoors. A stroll through one of Boston\u2019s historic coffee houses might just be the perfect remedy\u2014a chance to savor warmth in a steaming cup while gazing out at the mists enveloping the streets. Alternatively, one could find solace in the pages of a good book at home, the sound of rain tapping against the windows providing the perfect soundtrack. In these soft, muted hours, let the promise of warmer days ahead rest easy in your mind, and savor tonight\u2019s embrace of nature\u2019s more melancholic moods.",
