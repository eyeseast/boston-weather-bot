    "weather_report": "In Boston, the afternoon unfolds under a welcoming sky, vibrant with sunlight filtering through puffs of gentle clouds. The air is warm yet buoyed by the soft whisper of a southwest breeze, creating an inviting atmosphere that suggests an afternoon well spent outdoors. As the sun takes its gradual descent, the evening promises a subtle transition, with a hint of warmth still lingering into the night, where the stars may soon find a place among wisps of partly cloudy skies. \n\nFor those venturing out, a light layer will suffice, perhaps a shirt with breathable fabrics that dance with the warmth, complemented by comfortable pants to allow for easy movement as the hours stretch long into the evening. The pleasantness of the day invites a stroll along the waterfront or a visit to an open-air caf\u00e9 where one might savor a refreshing drink while watching the world saunter by. Alternatively, the city\u2019s vibrant parks can be perfect for gathering with friends, sharing laughter and stories until the dusk wraps its embrace around the day.",
