    "weather_report": "As dawn approaches, Boston finds itself wrapped in a shroud of clouds, hinting at the moisture that may grace the morning. A delicate chance of rain lingers in the air, creeping in softly after five, as the night whispers into the early hours. The temperature will gently cradle around 61, providing a slight chill that invites a light sweater or a cozy jacket for those stepping outside. The gentle breeze from the south, caressing at around six miles per hour, adds to the comforting ambiance of a summer's night transitioning into a quiet, overcast dawn.\n\nAs the day unfolds, the clouds promise both company and intrigue. A chance for rain showers will hover before nine, giving way to patchy fog that weaves through the city's streets. The afternoon may greet us with moments of clarity as temperatures rise to a warm embrace of nearly 80 degrees, perfect for leisurely strolls along the park or a cup of coffee al fresco. Attire should lean towards a blend of comfort and practicality; light layers are advisable, accommodating the day's shifting moods. While the weather might deter grand outdoor adventures, a leisurely visit to a favorite cafe, a comforting read at home, or a stroll through the lesser-known nooks of the city could reveal delightful surprises hidden in the misty morning.",
