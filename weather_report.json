    "weather_report": "As midnight settles over Boston, the city is enveloped in a gentle shroud of clouds, draping itself in an almost ethereal hush. The warmth lingers, with temperatures resting comfortably around 70 degrees, drawing a gentle breeze from the southwest that rustles the leaves and hints at the promise of a brighter morrow. The interplay of urban lights glimmers like scattered stars, caught in the metallic embrace of the skyline, while the city breathes softly, taking its rest.\n\nBut as dawn approaches, those clouds will part to reveal a tapestry of golden sunlight cascading over the cityscape, transforming Boston into a vibrant, lively canvas. Tomorrow, under the benevolent gaze of the sun, expect temperatures to rise near 83 degrees, complemented by a lively west wind that dances through the streets, possibly stirring a few hats and loose papers. With such delightful weather, a casual outfit would be fitting; soft, light fabrics are ideal, perhaps in shades of blue and white to echo the sky\u2019s clarity. A leisurely stroll along the Charles River could provide respite and joy, or perhaps a visit to a quiet caf\u00e9 to sip coffee while watching the world wake around you. Engage with the day, embrace its warmth, and relish the simple pleasures it offers.",
