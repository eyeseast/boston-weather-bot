    "weather_report": "As the night wraps Boston in its cool embrace, a sense of anticipation hangs in the air. The forecast whispers of a slight chance of snow, teasing the senses just before the dawn gives way to rain mixed with lingering flakes. With temperatures huddling around thirty-four, a gentle southerly breeze offers a subtle reminder of the changing seasons. If you\u2019re heading out, layering is key\u2014think of a cozy sweater beneath a waterproof jacket, perhaps with a sturdy pair of boots to navigate the damp terrain.\n\nAs Thursday emerges from the shadows, the promise of rain looms larger, a grey blanket of clouds that seems intent on soaking the landscape. The high will flirt with fifty, casting off the chill of the night but not yet shedding the necessity of a warm scarf as the wind picks up throughout the day. This is the kind of day made for settling into a quiet caf\u00e9, warmed by the comforting aroma of coffee and pastry, or perhaps diving into a good book at home, the pitter-patter of rain composing an intimate symphony outside. The drizzly air beckons a slower pace, so embrace the moment with introspection or a leisurely stroll, mindful of the puddles waiting to splash underfoot.",
