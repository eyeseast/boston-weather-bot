    "weather_report": "As night descends over Boston, the air carries a crispness that hints at the chill awaiting the dawn. Currently, the city is cloaked in a tranquil darkness, punctuated by the glimmer of lights reflecting off the surfaces of quiet streets. With a low temperature around 15, a northwest wind stirs softly, rustling through the branches of trees and whispering through empty avenues. There's an absence of fog, the air clear and invigorating, making this a perfect evening for a brief stroll bundled in warm layers\u2014perhaps a heavy coat, a cozy scarf, and sturdy boots, preparing for the quick nip of the night breeze.\n\nMoving into the day ahead, the sun will rise into a pristine sky to bid a cheerful hello. The promise of sunshine bathes the city in warmth by mid-morning; temperatures will gently rise to near 27, ideal for outdoor pursuits. A leisurely walk along the Charles River, or perhaps a visit to one of Boston's quaint coffee shops, could invite the joy of a good book and fragrant steam wafting in the air. For those who treasure the routines of life, it\u2019s an opportune day to bask in the sun's embrace\u2014while dressed comfortably in layers that can be shed or adorned as the day unfolds.",
